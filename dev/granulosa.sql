This feature adds two new pages in the admin interface to help end users maintain a healthy site through common configuration issues and other elements that go along with having a robust online presence. It also provides a standardized location for developers to add debugging information.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Fatal Error Recovery Mode</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/16/fatal-error-recovery-mode-in-5-2/">The Fatal Error Recovery Mode feature</a> was originally planned for the 5.1 release but was delayed to patch up some last-minute issues that arose. This feature will help site-owners recover more quickly from fatal errors that break the display or functionality of their site that would ordinarily require code or database edits to fix.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Privacy and Accessibility Updates</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with the headlining features mentioned above, there are some important enhancements to the privacy and accessibility features included in Core. These include <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/24/developer-focused-privacy-updates-in-5-2/">some important developer-focused changes</a> to how privacy policy pages are displayed and user data is exported, as well as <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/02/admin-tabs-semantic-improvements-in-5-2/">moving to more semantic markup for admin tabs</a> and <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/24/notable-accessibility-changes-in-5-2/">other improvements</a> such as switching post format icons to drop-down menus on post list tables, improved admin toolbar markup, and contextual improvements to archive widget drop-down menu.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>New Dashicons</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/resource/dashicons/">Dashicons</a> library was last updated was over 3 years ago. Now, in the upcoming release, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/11/dashicons-in-wordpress-5-2/">a set of 13 new icons will be added to the library</a> along with improvements to the build process and file format of the icons.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Block Editor Upgrades</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Block Editor has seen <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/17/whats-new-in-gutenberg-17th-april/">numerous improvements</a> lately that will all be included in the v5.2 release. Along with the interface upgrades, the underlying Javascript module <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/09/the-block-editor-javascript-module-in-5-2/">has been reorganized</a>, improvements have been made to <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/04/17/block-editor-detection-improvements-in-5-2/">how the block editor is detected</a> on the post edit screen, and <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/03/25/building-javascript/">the Javascript build process has been enhanced</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2019/04/wordpress-5-2-release-candidate/">WordPress 5.2 is now in the Release Candidate phase</a> and you can test it by installing <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">the Beta Tester plugin</a> on any WordPress site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to get involved in building WordPress Core?

If you attempt to update WordPress manually, that update will fail. To continue using the latest features of WordPress you must update to a newer version of PHP. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When updating to a new version of PHP, WordPress encourages updating to its recommended version, PHP 7.3. The PHP internals team has done a great job making its most recent version the fastest version of PHP yet. This means that updating will improve the speed of your site, both for you and your visitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This performance increase also means fewer servers are needed to host websites. Updating PHP isn&#8217;t just good for your site, it also means less energy is needed for the <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2019/03/one-third-of-the-web/">1-in-3 sites that use WordPress</a>, so it&#8217;s good for the planet.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to Update PHP</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you need help updating to a new version of PHP, <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/update-php/">detailed documentation is available</a>.  This includes sample communication to send to your host for them to assist you. Many hosting companies have published information on how to <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/servehappy-resources/blob/master/tutorials/hosting-specific/tutorials-en.md">update PHP</a> that is specific for them. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5.6 now, but soon 7+</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the first increase in PHP required version for WordPress since <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2010/07/eol-for-php4-and-mysql4/">2010</a>, but may not be the only increase in 2019. The WordPress core team will monitor the adoption of the most recent versions of PHP with an eye towards making PHP 7+ the minimum version towards the end of the year. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><a href="https://wordpress.org/support/update-php/#how-to-update-your-websites-php-version-for-a-faster-more-secure-website">Update PHP today, so you can update WordPress tomorrow!</a></p></blockquote></figure>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:30:"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1";a:1:{s:7:"post-id";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"6810";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:48:"\n		\n		\n				\n		\n				\n\n		\n				\n								\n										";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:4:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"The Month in WordPress: March 2019";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:69:"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/04/the-month-in-wordpress-march-2019/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 01 Apr 2019 08:59:01 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:18:"Month in WordPress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=6846";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:368:"WordPress reached a significant milestone this month.

This release will include some great new features, along with <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/03/20/whats-new-in-gutenberg-20th-march/">the latest updates to the block editor</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most anticipated new features is the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/03/20/the-improved-fatal-error-protection/">improved fatal error detection</a> &#8211; this was removed from v5.1 shortly before release so that it could be improved and made more secure for this release.

In an effort to make it easier for content creators to find these block types, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2019/03/08/the-block-directory-and-a-new-type-of-plugin/">there is a proposal</a> for a new type of plugin and a directory to handle it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The proposal outlines a new type of WordPress plugin that provides blocks and nothing else, named Single Block Plugins. The primary benefit would be to provide content creators with individual pieces of functionality and new types of blocks without the need to search for and install new plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Single Block Plugins would be hosted in a separate Block Directory section of the Plugin Directory and they would initially be JavaScript-based. Each plugin will register a single block, and they will be searchable and installable from within the editor itself. This puts blocks at the publishers’ fingertips &#8212; you no longer have to leave the editor to find them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to get involved in shaping this new type of plugin?

It gives users the ability to timestamp their posts and pages to demonstrate transparency and claim ownership of content.</p>\n<p>WordProof works with any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EOS.IO" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">EOSIO</a> blockchain to create the timestamp and provides a custom certificate link with a frontend pop-up to display it.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/timestamp-certificate.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The plugin adds a &#8220;View the blockchain certificate&#8221; link under each post or page, which pops up the URL, title, content, timestamp information, and will soon also display revisions. Users will be able to browse through different timestamps to view the changes. </p>\n<p>WordProof Timestamp was created by <a href="https://www.van-ons.nl/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Van Ons</a>, a WordPress agency based in Amsterdam. This is the same company that recently open sourced <a href="https://wptavern.com/laraberg-a-gutenberg-implementation-for-laravel-is-now-in-beta" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Laraberg</a>, a package that allows developers building applications with Laravel to integrate the Gutenberg editor.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I have been working and investing with blockchain as a hobby since 2013,&#8221; Van Ons founder Sebastiaan van der Lans said. &#8220;After we built the <a href="https://nl.wordpress.org/plugins/wp-gdpr-compliance/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WP GDPR Compliance</a> plugin and started working Laraberg, I am trying to work more and more on open source projects. From my point of view, WordPress + blockchain could not only democratize publishing but also doing business as a whole.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Van der Lans said he expects that any type of publishing website or any site with &#8220;Terms &#038; Conditions&#8221; pages can benefit from timestamping. It&#8217;s especially useful in mediating claims of plagiarism and content theft. WordProof has no transaction costs and is almost instant (0.5s). Van der Lans said it was important for this solution to have no transaction fees, since it is fundamental to proving the author&#8217;s identity and the integrity of the content.</p>\n<p>Right now the plugin offers the ability to timestamp an entire article, including the title and content. Block level time-stamping is not on the roadmap, but the team is open to adding it in the future. They are currently looking into time-stamping media files and legal documents.</p>\n<p>After launching the plugin in beta, a team of 60 testers, from both the WordPress and EOS.IO blockchain communities, gave feedback that led to the creation of a WordProof Wizard to make it easier for users to set up the required accounts.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our testers&#8217; main concern: it was too difficult to create an account on the blockchain and download and set-up a blockchain wallet afterwards,&#8221; Van Ons head of product Jelle van der Schoot said. &#8220;Therefore, we invested a lot of time into improving the UI/UX of the entire process (downloading the plugin, creating a blockchain account, downloading and setting up a wallet, timestamping).&#8221;</p>\n<p>The wizard supports both Telos and EOS and guides users through the process of setting up an account directly inside the WordPress dashboard.

There are already several free WordPress plugins that have similar functionality and work with various blockchain technology, such as <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-blockchain/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WP Blockchain</a>, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/stampd-io-blockchain-stamping/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">STAMPD.IO</a>, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/po-et/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Po.et</a>, and <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/mingrana-wp-to-blockchain/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mingrana WP to Blockchain</a>.

The platform allows approved authors to cross-post their blog articles on the new <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">FreeCodeCamp News</a> site for free, without any ads.  </p>\n<p>&#8220;Medium was a great place to publish because it helped a lot of people discover your articles. But the community has outgrown Medium,&#8221; FreeCodeCamp founder Quincy Larson said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Medium has shifted to a paywall model where they mainly recommend paywalled articles, then encourage visitors to pay to get around their paywall.</p>\n<p>&#8220;At the same time, not much of the traffic to Medium articles comes from Medium itself. Most of it comes from Google and social media.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In the detailed public <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/forum/t/we-just-moved-off-of-medium-and-onto-freecodecamp-news-heres-how-you-can-use-it/279929" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announcement</a> on the FreeCodeCamp forums, Larson said he noticed his articles started to get less distribution after he decided that putting them behind a paywall would not be compatible with the mission of his organization.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As of 2019, Medium won’t give you much &#8216;distribution&#8217; within their platform unless you’re willing to put your articles to be behind their paywall,&#8221; Larson said. &#8220;At the same time, if you do put your article behind their paywall, you’re limiting your readership to just the people who have the resources to pay. This is at odds with the goals of the freeCodeCamp community. We want to make these learning resources as widely available as possible.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In an email to blog authors who had published on FreeCodeCamp&#8217;s Medium publication, Larson elaborated on more serious concerns that he had with the platform&#8217;s approach to his organization. Oleg Isonen, one of the blog authors, <a href="https://twitter.com/oleg008/status/1134475953470656513/photo/1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">published the contents of the email</a>, which was later deleted at Larson&#8217;s request.</p>\n<p>&#8220;But over the past year Medium had become more aggressive toward us,&#8221; Larson said. &#8220;They have pressured us to put our articles behind their paywalls. We refused. So they tried to buy us. (Which makes no sense. We&#8217;re a public charity.) We refused. Then they started threatening us with a lawyer.&#8221; </p>\n<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-31-at-1.48.01-PM.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Many of those who read the email <a href="https://twitter.com/ossia/status/1134511135686877184" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">encouraged Larson to write a follow-up article</a>, as Medium&#8217;s tactics towards publishers are a matter of legitimate public concern, both to those who use the platform and readers who support the company through subscriptions. </p>\n<p>Larson responded, confirming that he sent the email but that he wanted to move on from the situation.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">This email was intended only for Oleg and a few of our other authors.

The articles will still be available on Medium, but from now on freeCodeCamp plans to publish on its own platform. The site promises users full control, better analytics, AMP support, and a better reader experience that doesn&#8217;t require people to sign in or pay to read articles.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m optimistic that all of us in the developer community can start our own blogs on the open web, then use community tools like freeCodeCamp News to raise awareness of them,&#8221; Larson said. </p>\n<p>Medium abruptly changed course in 2017 to become a publisher of subscription-based content, <a href="https://wptavern.com/medium-aims-to-fix-broken-media-with-new-5-subscription-program" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">scrapping the ad-driven revenue model</a> without notifying publishers ahead of time. Many publications that had invested heavily in building a following on Medium were forced to leave after discovering that the company did not have their best interests in mind. Medium&#8217;s new paywalled content model, which CEO Ev Williams claims is &#8220;a different, bolder approach&#8221; targeted at fixing what is broken with media, could not sustain publishers who were convinced to join the platform in its earlier days. </p>\n<p>FreeCodeCamp joins a wave of other publications that are <a href="https://wptavern.com/publishers-are-moving-back-to-wordpress-after-short-experiments-with-medium" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">moving back to WordPress</a> and other open source platforms. This trend is set to continue as Medium&#8217;s obtrusive popups and poor reader experience drive readers away from the content hosted there. Publishers who are in it for the long haul, those who value stability and full control of their content, will return to the open web. </p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sat, 01 Jun 2019 00:07:26 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:65:"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 354 – Pantheon Acquires StagingPilot";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:59:"https://wptavern.com/?p=90371&preview=true&preview_id=90371";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:72:"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-354-pantheon-acquires-stagingpilot";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2065:"<p>In this episode, <a href="http://jjj.me">John James Jacoby</a> and I discuss Panethon&#8217;s acquisition of StagingPilot and why regression visual testing will likely become a standard feature across managed WordPress hosts if it&#8217;s not already.

Starting a new page from scratch may be overwhelming for those who don&#8217;t have a vision for how to tastefully put blocks together to lay out the page. This is a problem that this experimental plugin may be able to solve.</p>\n<p>Full Site Editing currently provides three custom blocks for post content, templates, and a blog posts listing. The Blog Posts Listing block expands upon core&#8217;s Latest Posts block to include an excerpt and meta information.</p>\n<p>The plugin is available in the WordPress Plugin Directory, although it is somewhat difficult to find when searching in the admin plugin installer. The most recent 0.1.1 version of the plugin seems to be broken, but if you roll back to the initial release, you can see some of the page template experiments. After activating the plugin, navigate to <strong>Pages &raquo; Add New</strong> and a new modal with a template selector should pop up.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-30-at-1.28.36-PM.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The templates come pre-filled with demo content and images, so the user doesn&#8217;t have to think about how to configure the blocks to match the demo. </p>\n<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/full-site-editing-plugin.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The functionality in Full Site Editing is being developed for use on WordPress.com. It makes sense for a network that regularly onboards new bloggers and site owners. It is in the company&#8217;s best interest to deliver the fastest possible site creation experience, rather than have new users get frustrated and confused about how to get started. </p>\n<p>A template selector for creating new pages could also be useful for the broader WordPress community. Plugin developer Jeffrey Carandang tested Full Site Editing and <a href="https://twitter.com/phpbits/status/1133677497789194240" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">suggested</a> that it might be useful to add this functionality to Gutenberg with custom hooks so that developers can add their own custom templates. This would make guiding users through the new theme setup process much easier for theme shops.</p>\n<p>Automattic has a label on the Calypso repository dedicated to categorizing issues in the <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/labels/%5BGoal%5D%20Full%20Site%20Editing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">full site editing</a> project. The plugin is going to be enabled on a small set of sites for <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/issues/33163" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">initial testing</a>. There are quite a few issues that still need to be ironed out, including things like preventing users from deleting the header and footer and finalizing the theme used with the plugin. At the moment, the plugin seems to be tailored specifically to the Twenty Nineteen theme and the pre-filled templates do not look as good when used with other themes.</p>\n<p>The functionality included in the Full Site Editing plugin may also be coming to Jetpack. Automattic&#8217;s developers are currently <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/issues/32490" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">researching the best way to include it</a>, since so far it has been developed as a separate plugin and not geared towards becoming a Jetpack module.</p>\n<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/full-site-editing/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Full Site Editing</a> is not recommended for use in production, as it&#8217;s still under active development. The plugin&#8217;s details explicitly state that it is &#8220;only designed to work on the WordPress.com environment and could break after an update.&#8221; Check it out if you want to explore some exciting new possibilities for how the block editor can work together with themes to make page creation more approachable for users. </p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 30 May 2019 22:17:29 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:75:"WPTavern: Pantheon Acquires Visual Regression Testing Platform StagingPilot";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=90288";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:86:"https://wptavern.com/pantheon-acquires-visual-regression-testing-platform-stagingpilot";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2952:"<p><a href="https://pantheon.io">Panethon</a>, a managed host geared towards Drupal and WordPress sites, <a href="https://pantheon.io/blog/robots-autopilot-and-holy-grail-webops">has acquired</a> <a href="https://stagingpilot.com/">StagingPilot</a>. Financial details of the deal were not disclosed. Nathan Tyler, founder of StagingPilot, and his brother Phil Tyler will be brought into the company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>StagingPilot is a four year old company that runs a barrage of visual regression tests on WordPress sites before they&#8217;re automatically updated. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>StagingPilot creates a copy of the site and places it into a staging environment. The service then conducts a number of tests that include, checking for visual errors, a white screen of death, and elements on a page disappearing. A number of snapshots are created along with a detailed report on the errors that are discovered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Josh Koenig, Co-Founder and Head of Product at Pantheon, says the acquisition puts the company within reach of the &#8216;Holy Grail&#8217; of WebOps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Once you have a hundred sites (or heck, even twenty), the grind of keeping up with routine updates can be daunting,&#8221; Koenig said. &#8220;Our existing WebOps tools let our customers automate a lot of that maintenance, but building and managing that automation is on them. We want our users to automate their operations, not operate their automation.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pantheon plans to integrate StagingPilot into its offerings in three phases. First, it will migrate StagingPilot&#8217;s technology into its existing managed updates feature and extend it beyond WordPress to support Drupal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, the company plans to fully integrate the service with its organizational features providing substantial benefits to agency partners or those who manage many sites. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third phase looks to take advantage of services such as Google&#8217;s applied learning machines to create AI-driven testing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Out-of-the box, WordPress only updates minor versions automatically and leaves major updates, plugins, and themes up to the user. One of the most common fears of enabling auto-updates is having something on the site break. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Often, the process of testing updates is left up to the consultant or whoever manages the site. Depending on the size or number of sites being managed, it can become a major time suck. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hosting companies like Pantheon with StagingPilot, <a href="https://www.liquidweb.com/products/managed-wordpress/">LiquidWeb</a>, and others are easing the fear of auto updates in general and saving people a lot of time by using automatic visual regression testing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To learn more about StagingPilot and to see Nathan demo the service in-person, check out this <a href="https://www.wpwatercooler.com/video/stagingpilot-w-nathan-tyler-wpshowandtell/">episode of WPshowandtell</a> hosted by Jason Tucker. </p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 30 May 2019 01:32:28 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:81:"WPTavern: Gutenberg 5.8 Released with Prototype of New Block-based Widgets Screen";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=90267";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:92:"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-5-8-released-with-prototype-of-new-block-based-widgets-screen";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3753:"<p><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/05/29/whats-new-in-gutenberg-29th-may/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Gutenberg 5.8</a> was released today with three new features and more than three dozen enhancements, documentation improvements, and bug fixes. </p>\n<p>This release gives users the ability to <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/15625" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">change the text color in the Heading block</a>.

These are sites Google defines as &#8220;previously unknown to Google Search.&#8221; </p>\n<p>Mobile searches are the primary way that users engage with the search engine for the past few years, which caused Google to begin prodding website owners to make their content more mobile friendly. Google&#8217;s indexing and ranking systems originally used the desktop version of a page&#8217;s content, but this can cause problems when desktop and mobile sites contain different versions of content. </p>\n<p>Mobile-indexing is not default for all websites yet, but Google started rolling it out more widely in 2018. Google evaluates older websites for readiness based on a variety of factors: </p>\n<blockquote><p>For existing websites we determine their readiness for mobile-first indexing based on parity of content (including text, images, videos, links), structured data, and other meta-data (for example, titles and descriptions, robots meta tags). We recommend double-checking these factors when a website is launched or significantly redesigned.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that there is no separate &#8220;mobile-first index.&#8221; Google still references a unified index for serving search results. The difference is in whether a page is crawled by a desktop or mobile user-agent.</p>\n<p>Prior to responsive web design becoming the industry standard, having a separate mobile site was a common practice. Google is actively discouraging this approach now (although still supporting it), as it often causes confusion for users and search engines alike.</p>\n<p>WordPress sites using a responsive theme shouldn&#8217;t have any issues with mobile indexing as long as they are not farming out their mobile sites to a separate domain. A responsive theme is usually enough to make a site compatible with this method of crawling.</p>\n<p>Website owners can check to see how their sites are being crawled by clicking on the &#8220;URL Inspection&#8221; tab inside the Google Search Console. </p>\n<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-28-at-9.37.57-PM.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Webmasters of older sites will <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-floods-webmasters-with-mobile-first-indexing-enabled-notifications-305712" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">get a notification</a> from the Search Console when their sites are moved over to mobile-first indexing. </p>\n<p>After successfully ramping up mobile-first indexing from a small-scale experiment a few years ago, making it the default for new domains should be a good test for evaluating how aggressively it can be rolled out in the future.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 29 May 2019 15:49:21 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:60:"HeroPress: I Grew Up With WordPress, Then WordPress Saved Me";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:56:"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=2839";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:170:"https://heropress.com/essays/i-grew-up-with-wordpress-then-wordpress-saved-me/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=i-grew-up-with-wordpress-then-wordpress-saved-me";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:10666:"<img width="960" height="480" src="https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/052819-min-1024x512.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="Pull Quote: I wouldn\'t have made it through some of the hardest times in my life without WordPress." /><p>I grew up in the 90s and 2000s which was a weird time for technology. Part of me remembers carrying around a case of cassette tapes and the sound of dial-up occasionally screaming from the living room. The other half recalls hacking into my dad’s email from the shared family computer for the first time when I was ten. His passwords were never very hard to guess.</p>\n<p>In 2004 or 2005, I started taking more of an interest in the Internet. I wanted to start a blog maybe, but I wasn’t sure what a blog even was. WordPress was one of the first things I stumbled on, but it was still an infant compared to what it’s evolved into and I had no idea how it worked. Was WordPress a blogging website? Was it a thing I could build my own site with? How did it work?</p>\n<p>I just wanted somewhere to be myself online and WordPress intimidated me. So I dabbled, but I didn’t stay. Myspace and Tumblr would teach me to use HTML, because after all, I just wanted my own place to write online.</p>\n<h3>Finding My Way Back to WordPress</h3>\n<p>Eventually, my writing career led me back to WordPress. I was in college, studying English Literature when the opportunity for a Marketing Internship opened up. Around 2011, Chartwells Higher Education, a food service company for college campuses, had launched a huge multi-site network of university dining websites.</p>\n<p>Their largest initiative that year was to drive website traffic.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Mine was to keep the students from kicking us off campus because of how much everyone hated Campus Dining.</p></blockquote>\n<p>So I started a blog.</p>\n<p>“The Inside Scoop” gave students the perspective of a student who works for campus dining. Both goals were met and I fell in love with the idea of using writing to address business problems. Even more exciting, I finally understood WordPress. Although by then, nearly ten years had passed and WordPress had completely changed.</p>\n<h3>Life Changed (a LOT), but WordPress Was Always There</h3>\n<p>At the same time throughout college, I went through a major transition from life as an extremely active athlete to someone with mobility problems. I broke my back, went through everything you can think of to fix it, and ended up with a permanent disability.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, I knew by then how to work on a computer in an environment that didn’t necessarily require me to be in an office. It took a few years of adjustment, but eventually, I ended up working for a WordPress-based marketing agency remotely from an RV, which I took anywhere I felt like going.</p>\n<p>For a few years, I became a professional tourist.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I’d wake up, get some work done, then adventure all day.</p></blockquote>\n<p>By the time I was done, I could tour any city in a single day and still keep up with content writing. But writing content was all I did. Naturally, I still wanted my own website to write on, but all I had was Tumblr. How to actually set up a WordPress site from start to finish was a mystery to me.</p>\n<p>My partner at the agency was supposed to build the site for me, but it never happened. By the time my RV broke down in Rhode Island, 3,500 miles from my hometown, I had lost my chance to build a true travel blog and #vanlife became way too much of a fad to interest me anymore.</p>\n<h3>Learning to Build Websites with WordPress</h3>\n<p>My next step was to build my own website. I probably owe a lot of my “self-taught” skills to websites like WP Beginner and WPCrafter, but I really can’t remember how I learned other than trying and failing many times.</p>\n<p>After a few YouTube videos, I dove in and built the worst website that you could possibly imagine. It was atrocious, but I liked it enough, so I started writing on TaylorElizabethRose.com and building more websites.</p>\n<h3>Returning to a Burning California</h3>\n<p>My next few years were spent spinning my wheels on the East Coast and essentially failing at everything I tried. So I made a plan to move back to California and start my own WordPress-based business. By then I had learned a lot about website management, or so I thought.</p>\n<p>The first version of <a href="http://TaylordInk.com">TaylordInk.com</a> was launched in May of 2017 before I made the trip back to California in September.</p>\n<p>As we drove into Napa Valley, I noticed how dry it looked and said,“This is a fire hazard.” There were no fire breaks and I had seen what the terrain looks like before it burns when my house burned in San Diego in 2007. Napa and Santa Rosa were primed for flames.</p>\n<blockquote><p>But, how many times in one person’s life can their house burn down?</p></blockquote>\n<p>It was less than two weeks later when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tubbs_Fire">the Tubbs Fire</a> came through and burned my entire future. The man I’d been with for two years ended up abandoning me. My business equipment was gone. Any professional clothes I may have had were incinerated. All I had were my dogs and my 2013 MacBook Pro, which happened to be with me at the time.</p>\n<h3>Nothing but a Laptop</h3>\n<p>Between October and December 2017, I couldn’t tell you much about what I did or what happened except that I ended up back in my hometown: San Diego. It was a blur of loneliness, depression, and complete failure. Finally, sometime mid-December, I logged into my personal website.</p>\n<p>May as well start with my own identity.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It was hacked… and gone. I failed to update while I was swimming in my own sorrow.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Luckily, my friend from my agency days actually had a backup of the original site. So I salvaged the posts from his files and started rebuilding. I really didn’t get very far until much later in 2019. I just kept designing and redesigning the same pages over and over again.</p>\n<p>On the second or third time I logged in after the fire, I saw the WordCamp San Diego information on the Dashboard and bought a ticket before I could change my mind about going.</p>\n<h3>Discovering the WordPress Community</h3>\n<p>WordCamp San Diego didn’t happen until months later, but it was the next time I really did anything productive in my life. It was kind of my last-ditch attempt to start a WordPress business or any business at all.</p>\n<p>I didn’t know what to expect. I didn’t know who I would meet, or how (or if) I would fit in. I certainly never expected to find a community with open arms.</p>\n<p>A weight was lifted from my shoulders almost immediately. Where had all these nerds been my whole life? These were my people!</p>\n<blockquote><p>There’s a comfort that comes from fitting into a community and finding your people.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Being in the company of like-minded people makes the future less bleak. I had hope again for the first time since the fire stole that from me.</p>\n<p>At some point during that WordCamp, a girl named Sochi found out that I was a content writer. She dragged me by the hand to meet <a href="https://twitter.com/learnwithmattc?s=17">Matt Cromwell</a> at the Give booth. It was extremely intimidating because the entire Give Team was sitting there staring at me. I didn’t know it then, but I was meeting my own future coworkers.</p>\n<p>Give was hiring a content writer! In fact, they were close to hiring someone else, but I was intrigued. So I inquired the next day and disrupted Matt’s hiring process a bit.</p>\n<p>The next week, I joined Team Give.</p>\n<p>Over the next year, I spoke at 4 WordCamps and attended 6 or 7 total.</p>\n<p>Working at Impress.org and participating in WordCamps has been incredible and I’ve learned more about WordPress over the past year than in all the years before.

Mullenweg shared his journey in a &#8220;thinking out loud&#8221; style throughout the process of selecting the best route for templating and other decisions that laid the groundwork for the first release. Since those early days, WordPress has outpaced all its early competitors to become the most popular CMS by a wide margin. </p>\n<p>Sixteen years later, the software is available in more than 200 languages and is now used by <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress/all/all" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">33.9%</a> of the top ten million websites. WordPress&#8217; uncommon growth can be attributed to its unique combination of leadership, stability, and a community of thousands of contributors and entrepreneurs that are empowered by its open source licensing. </p>\n<p>Many WordPress product businesses, part of a commercial ecosystem that Mullenweg estimates at $10 billion/year, hosted sales, giveaways, and promotions in honor of the anniversary.

Unfortunately, it wasn&#8217;t a good one.</p>\n<blockquote><p>When somebody comes to your project with a well-thought-out, unit-tested fix, and is met by radio silence? The chances are high that they will never come back again. I have submitted WordPress patches in the past, but after this experience I don’t know if I will bother submitting them again. That’s a big change in my perspective on how the WordPress team works, and on how it should work.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Jalkut isn&#8217;t the first nor will he be the last to have an experience like this. WordPress is a large project that encompasses many areas and if a particular ticket is not in line with higher priorities, the chances of it slipping through the cracks are pretty high.</p>\n<h2>Human Made Launches A New Product but Some People Have No Idea What It Is</h2>\n<p>Human Made has <a href="https://humanmade.com/2019/05/21/beyond-wordpress-10-year-evolution-human-made/">launched a new product</a> called <a href="http://altis-dxp.com/">Altis</a> which is a DXP or Digital Experience Platform for WordPress.

However, this also raises concerns about how sponsor expectations may influence a project&#8217;s development.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You can now sponsor developers as a seamless part of your familiar workflow,&#8221; GitHub open source project manager Devon Zuegel said in the announcement. &#8220;When a contributor answers your question, triages your issue, or merges your code, you can head to their profile—or simply hover over their username—to sponsor their work.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/native-workflow-white.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Sponsorship is a somewhat subjective term and GitHub isn&#8217;t defining what it means here in the context of marrying it to a contributor&#8217;s workflow. For some, it may mean a no-strings-attached donation. For others, the idea of sponsorship always comes the expectation of a return on an investment. </p>\n<p>Ruby on Rails creator and Basecamp founder David Heinemeier Hansson was one of the most prominent to <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1131585498395242496" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">raise concerns about GitHub&#8217;s Sponsors program on Twitter</a>. He sees it as &#8220;a grave risk to open source.&#8221; </p>\n<p>“&#8217;Why haven’t you fixed my issue yet!? I sent you $10! I demand you honor your obligations here. I paid you,&#8217; welcome to small-donation open source 2019,&#8221; Hansson said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’m sure GitHub had all the right intentions here. And I’m sure this will work out well for a select few developers who will amass enough donations to ignore individual claims to their time. But I think it’s a grave risk to the culture of open source.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Hansson referenced a recent keynote he delivered at RailsConf 2019 titled &#8220;<a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/open-source-beyond-the-market/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Open source beyond the market</a>,&#8221; challenging those whose initial reactions are simply that &#8220;donations are a good thing.&#8221; Bringing the concept of sponsorship a into the workflow introduces a transactional nature to the work, with unavoidable marketplace expectations that can complicate a project&#8217;s development.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The marketplace norms are hard to escape,&#8221; Hansson said in his keynote. &#8220;They seep into our unconsciousness. There are plenty of open source users who think themselves less as a recipient of a gift and more like customers with warranty claims, that they’ve done the makers of said open source software a great honor by merely choosing to use their thing.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In fact, it’s kind of a natural extension of a society that worships consumerism above little less. A natural extension of &#8216;the customer is always right,&#8217; of the adversarial relationship between buyer and seller.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Others have expressed more specific concerns, such as Microsoft&#8217;s GitHub becoming the dominant payment platform for open source developers, sponsors receiving priority consideration in issues and PRs over user and project needs, and developers deliberately introducing bugs in order to solicit donations. </p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Already seeing “I will prioritise your issues” in the ‘rewards’ sections on the first sponsor-enabled accounts&#8230; so.. you called it</p>\n<p>&mdash; Lasse Rafn (@LasseRafn) <a href="https://twitter.com/LasseRafn/status/1131601620582764555?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 23, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Pia Mancini, co-founder of Open Collective, <a href="https://medium.com/open-collective/on-github-sponsors-5450b63caf7d" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote a response</a> to the concerns that people were sending her way on Twitter. </p>\n<p>&#8220;I am really happy to see such an important player in the ecosystem helping out with the problem of sustaining open source,&#8221; Mancini said. &#8220;Sustaining our commons is an effort that requires everyone to contribute. I am glad to see Github come on board.&#8221; </p>\n<p>This idea of the sustainability of open source and the &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tragedy of the commons</a>&#8221; is one that <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/open-source-beyond-the-market/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hansson and many others reject</a>, but it is one that is commonly embraced by copyleft advocates. It works for Open Collective&#8217;s business model, but comes with its own flavor of reciprocity. Open Collective is distinct in that its funding service is removed from the direct workflow of software development, instead of deeply integrated like GitHub&#8217;s Sponsors tool. </p>\n<p>Mancini said that her company can &#8220;happily coexist with GitHub Sponsors&#8221; because of Open Collective&#8217;s chief differentiators. It was built for projects, not individuals. It offers full transparency about where funds come from and how they are spent. The company also manages the paperwork and tax forms required for fiscal sponsorship. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Open Collective is for funding projects as opposed to individual maintainers,&#8221; Mancini said. &#8220;We strongly believe in supporting communities as a whole, as well as the individuals that make up that community. This helps with ensuring more diversity, and less concentration of power and decisions on one maintainer.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She also cautioned against GitHub trying to swallow up too many aspects of the open source community and injecting its own corporate interests. She hints at a line that the company has not yet crossed but many are still wary of what Microsoft plans to do with GitHub.  </p>\n<p>&#8220;Of course, there’s risk: centralization and lock-in are very risky for communities,&#8221; Mancini said. &#8220;GitHub is Microsoft, which has its own metrics in mind, and it will be difficult for them to be independent, regardless of the good faith of the folks involved.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Attempting to own all aspects of the open source community is a harmful strategy. So far, I don’t think GitHub is trying to do this. They are in a position to help, and they are open to collaborating with existing players.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Does it compete with Open Collective? To some extent. But our growth has never been primarily driven by individuals giving to individuals, but by companies giving to projects. GitHub Sponsors does not solve the need sponsor companies have for invoices and a legal entity to engage with for their vendor systems and documentation requirements.&#8221;</p>\n<p>GitHub&#8217;s intentions may simply be a recognition of what open source software has matured to become &#8211; a driving force of innovation in all industries and an effort worthy of financial support. Giving developers an easy way to receive some reward for their contributions seems rather innocuous, but the concern is that Microsoft cannot foresee the long term consequences of its sponsorship implementation inside GitHub&#8217;s workflow. Open source project maintainers who <a href="https://wptavern.com/github-responds-to-letter-from-open-source-project-maintainers" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pressed GitHub for more consideration of open source workflows</a> may get more than they bargained for.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 24 May 2019 18:40:15 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:85:"WPTavern: Automattic Acquires Prospress, the company behind WooCommerce Subscriptions";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=90102";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:95:"https://wptavern.com/automattic-acquires-prospress-the-company-behind-woocommerce-subscriptions";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4052:"<p><a href="https://automattic.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Automattic</a> has acquired <a href="https://prospress.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Prospress</a> and its flagship <a href="https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WooCommerce Subscriptions</a> product, along with the company&#8217;s entire suite of e-commerce plugins and automation tools. Prospress&#8217; 20 employees will be joining Automattic to continue developing and supporting their products.</p>\n<p>There are no immediate changes planned for current WooCommerce Subscriptions customers. Automattic will begin working on a roadmap for the product after integrating the Prospress team into the company.</p>\n<p>In the <a href="https://woocommerce.com/posts/prospress-joins-automattic-to-jointly-develop-woocommerce-subscriptions/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announcement Q&#038;A</a>, Prospress founder Brent Shepherd said he is excited to see how Subscriptions will integrate with Automattic&#8217;s existing products and offered a glimpse at what they may be working on in the near future:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In more specific terms, that could mean looking at closer relationships with how payments are handled, or integrations with other platforms such as WordPress.com. There are also a couple of things to solve both in WooCommerce and subscriptions to help them scale better. Interestingly, these challenges are almost identical for the two codebases. By working more closely to solve them than we ever could apart, I hope we can do a better job of implementing solutions and in a shorter time frame.</p></blockquote>\n<p>WooCommerce Subscriptions can already be purchased a la carte and used on WordPress.com stores, so nothing will change in this department. I asked Paul Maiorana, head of partnerships for WooCommerce, if there are any plans to integrate Subscription functionality with Jetpack sites, as the plugin&#8217;s team is currently pursuing a Membership feature that is essentially recurring payments.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We’re excited to learn from the Prospress team as they’re experts in this space, and could see Memberships potentially leveraging some of the Subscriptions code to avoid duplicating efforts — but we have no plans to integrate the products,&#8221; Maiorana said.</p>\n<p>The Prospress acquisition also includes <a href="https://automatewoo.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">AutomateWoo</a>, a marketing automation tool, and <a href="https://robotninja.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Robot Ninja</a>, which offers automated checkout testing for WooCommerce stores. <a href="https://prospress.com/automatewoo-joins-prospress/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Prospress acquired AutomateWoo</a> in June 2018 as a complementary product to Subscriptions. There are no immediate changes planned for these products that would affect customers.</p>\n<p>Prospress has been deeply invested in the WooCoommerce open source project for many years. WooCommerce has 834 contributors and Shepherd is currently among the top 10. His company <a href="https://prospress.com/five-for-the-future-of-woocommerce/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">committed to the five for the future initiative</a> last year by sponsoring one of its employees to contribute full time to WooCommerce core. For the past five years Shepherd has also co-organized the WooCommerce San Francisco meet-up.</p>\n<p>Cornering the market on Subscriptions and being able to ensure a tight integration for customers gives WooCommerce a more competitive edge in the broader e-commerce space. Prospress&#8217; smaller products are also strategic additions to WooCommerce&#8217;s offerings. If Automattic can integrate the marketing automation and automated checkout testing tools in one hosted package, these tools have the potential to greatly increase customer&#8217;s success and confidence in their WooCommerce powered stores.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 23 May 2019 23:20:27 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:69:"WPTavern: Take the 2019 WP&amp;UP Mental Health and Well-Being Survey";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=90124";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:75:"https://wptavern.com/take-the-2019-wpup-mental-health-and-well-being-survey";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:652:"<p><a href="https://wpandup.org/">WP&amp;UP</a> is a mental health and well-being charitable organization founded by Dan Maby in 2018, whose mission is to promote positive mental health throughout the WordPress ecosystem. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The organization is currently <a href="https://wpandup.org/survey-2019.html">hosting a survey</a> to better understand the needs of the community. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The questions cover the general work environment, general mental health and well-being, and specific work-related mental health and well-being.

It has long been the highest revenue extension in the WooCommerce marketplace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Paul Maiorana, WooCommerce&#8217;s Head of Payments, Shipping, and Partnerships, tells me, <span class="pullquote alignleft">&#8220;Subscriptions is an important differentiator for WooCommerce amongst eCommerce platforms, and we’re really excited to now be working closely with the Prospress team to create a more unified experience.&#8221;</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have known Brent and his team for a long time, and I&#8217;ve used Subscriptions for many years. It&#8217;s an outstanding and complex project that requires enormous amounts of testing, a skilled development team, and a lot of care.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2017, the <a href="https://poststatus.com/notes/woocommerce-offering-20-higher-rates-trade-third-party-developers-offering-support/">support structure changed</a> for third-party WooCommerce extensions, which led to an immediate surge of support hiring by the largest extension providers — namely Prospress and SkyVerge — for whom, for the purpose of disclosure, I do contract work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Support is the biggest component of a plugin company, especially for a complex one like Subscriptions, which interfaces (sometimes in very different ways) with dozens of payment processors. I have seen spec documentation for their proposed new features, and it is astounding how much detail is required to be outlaid before a single line of code is changed or written.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Automattic, a company that formerly consisted of a few dozen folks now has the backing of hundreds of &#8220;Happiness Engineers&#8221; to help manage the load.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The primary risk I see for Subscriptions with Automattic is that it will get lost in the fray if Prospress developers are pulled to other work and more pressing needs. I have perceived this to be the case with their ownership of WP Job Manager, WooCommerce Bookings, and some other extensions — though none with the significance of Subscriptions. I think the strategic importance of Subscriptions <em>should</em> keep that at bay under good management, and I know Automattic management understands that strategic importance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automattic will eventually go public, I&#8217;m almost certain. Strategically, I fully believe the Prospress acquisition is the right move for them. If I were involved, I would&#8217;ve been trying to make this acquisition for years now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having significant revenue streams under the scope of a company out of your control is a risk, to my thinking as a theoretical investor. I would take this now in-house feature set direct to marketing channels against Shopify  <br />— which is an absolute juggernaut in the eCommerce space today, particularly among high revenue generating stores. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know what led Brent to make the choice to join Automattic now, but it&#8217;s a much-deserved exit after something like eight years of work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brent said the following <a href="https://woocommerce.com/posts/prospress-joins-automattic-to-jointly-develop-woocommerce-subscriptions/">in the announcement Q&amp;A</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>I’m extremely proud of what we’ve achieved at Prospress. I’ve had the great pleasure of having some amazing people join me over the years. Together I believe we’ve advanced a mission that matters to me — so much so that it predated Prospress and even WooCommerce.</p><p>I believe joining Automattic is the best next stage for Prospress, and I am personally excited to lead the transition and work with the Automattic team to further WooCommerce.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m very happy for Brent and the entire Prospress team. I hope they made a fortune with this acquisition; in my mind, Subscriptions is one of the key reasons for WooCommerce&#8217;s amazing growth as a platform. I think they will do great there, and I have no doubt they will stay committed to making Subscriptions continue as a terrific tool in the toolbox that is WooCommerce.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 23 May 2019 19:31:16 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Brian Krogsgard";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:74:"WPTavern: Google Updates Mobile Search Results to Include Website Branding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=90077";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:85:"https://wptavern.com/google-updates-mobile-search-results-to-include-website-branding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1999:"<p>Google is rolling out an <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/search/new-design-google-search/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">update to mobile search results</a> that includes website branding.

It is essentially a blank starter theme that offers 100% compatibility with <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/elementor/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Elementor</a>. </p>\n<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/hello-screenshot.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Page builders with a large user base are in a unique position to influence the WordPress theme market. Loyal users will often select a page builder before choosing a theme from a limited pool of those that boast compatibility with their preferred plugin. Elementor is no exception, with more than 2 million installations and a 4.8-star average rating on WordPress.org.</p>\n<p>Lately the trend with some of the most popular and intuitive WordPress themes is to offer a strong, niche design out of the box, where users don&#8217;t have to make too many choices or fiddle with settings. Hello takes a different path, opeorating as more of a conduit to the Elementor page template library. </p>\n<p>The theme&#8217;s screenshot shows a home page designed in Elementor but the actual theme has very few styles and doesn&#8217;t look like anything out of the box.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-22-at-1.44.58-PM.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Once installed, the first step is to create a page and select &#8220;Edit in Elementor.&#8221; From there users can select from a library of different landing page templates or start building their own layouts from scratch.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-22-at-4.50.56-PM.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Hello is not a new theme. Elementor first released it on GitHub in March 2018. Hosting it on WordPress.org allows users to more easily install it and get automatic updates for improvements and security fixes. </p>\n<p>&#8220;The plugin repository played a huge role in Elementor’s exceptional growth, and we hold similar high hopes for the Hello theme,&#8221; Elementor CMO Ben Pines said.</p>\n<p>There are a few major drawbacks to using the Hello theme that may hinder its potential growth. Access to headers, footers, and widgets is restricted to Elementor Pro users. This seems like a confusing way to build a WordPress site and might be a useful detail to include in the theme&#8217;s description on WordPress.org. If there&#8217;s another way to access headers and footers without purchasing Elementor Pro, I wasn&#8217;t able to find it.</p>\n<p>WooCommerce store owners should be aware that the Hello theme does not yet offer comprehensive support for WooCommerce page styles. Although the release post advertises the theme as having &#8220;out-of-the-box&#8221; compatibility with WooCommerce, the store pages are bare bones and not very attractive. One user commented that the checkout and cart pages do not look very inviting and asked if it will be possible to edit fonts and colors with Elementor. </p>\n<p>Elementor representative Matan Naveh responded to multiple concerns about WooCommerce support and said that full compatibility is still in development:</p>\n<blockquote><p>WooCommerce is a highly complex plugin and any pages that rely on its basic elements (e.g. Cart, My Account, Checkout, etc.) are even more so. The level of complexity is such that changes in something as routine as a WooCommerce update could cause havoc on a layout, resulting in a devastating effect on the webpage’s functionality.</p>\n<p>Currently, Elementor enables you to customize the areas surrounding the WooCommerce elements. Take the cart page, for example – You may not be able to customize the table itself, but you can customize the title or the area where the table is located. You can also insert your own images, backgrounds, and content according to your needs (e.g. adding an FAQ).</p>\n<p>We are considering several options for achieving full compatibility with WooCommerce. But this is still in its development stages.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Some users who switched from the Astra theme, another one commonly used by Elementor users, have <a href="https://elementor.com/blog/introducing-hello-theme/#comment-27019" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> <a href="https://elementor.com/blog/introducing-hello-theme/#comment-27035" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">significant (50%) decreases</a> in loading time on real world sites after switching to the Hello theme. Elementor claims that it is &#8220;the fastest WordPress theme ever created,&#8221; but the comparison benchmarks posted don&#8217;t include any themes that are known for high performance. </p>\n<p>Elementor is working on creating a child theme for Hello. It is currently in development on <a href="https://github.com/elementor/hello-theme-child" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and the team is working on getting it approved for WordPress.org.</p>\n<p>The primary purpose of the Hello theme is to offer compatibility with the page builder, but it is not recommended for users who are not using Elementor. </p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 23 May 2019 02:10:04 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:73:"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 353 – Slack of Boundaries and A Walk to WCEU";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:59:"https://wptavern.com/?p=90052&preview=true&preview_id=90052";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:80:"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-353-slack-of-boundaries-and-a-walk-to-wceu";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2125:"<p>In this episode, <a href="http://jjj.me">John James Jacoby</a> and I discuss an article published by Vox on how Slack is not improving productivity, especially in large team environments.

At that time, with a degree in graphic design at a state university in the Midwest, I was working in a field that had nothing to do with design or web. The small web marketing company I joined after graduation couldn’t make it through the dot com bubble. When I moved back to the U.S. with my then-husband for him to go back to graduate school in Detroit, I couldn’t re-enter the field because of my lack of experience. I settled with a temp in-house translator/admin assistant position at an automotive company to financially support the household. You could say it was a practical choice. Or, to put it frankly, I just gave up and went with the demand for the clerical job with Japanese skill.</p>\n<p>The good thing that came out of it was that I had plenty of time after work. My ex-husband had to study all day, and my temp job was precisely 9-5. Every night, we rarely watched T.V. or went out but headed for our computers. I worked on my own website and sometimes friend’s site for a fee, using just HTML and a little bit of CSS. Back then, reading blogs written by web designers was the best way to follow up-to-date news and techniques of frontend development.</p>\n<p>Inspired by those blogs in both English and Japanese, I decided to start mine. I published my first post on a Movable Type blog in April 2003. I wrote almost every day for a few months. Then as I was getting frustrated with some aspects of Movable Type, I tried several blog engines including WordPress.</p>\n<p>With WordPress, the process of customizing blog design through edits to PHP files was straightforward and enjoyable, so I got addicted to working with WordPress right away. I almost had no experience beyond HTML and CSS before then, but I was surprised that I was able to create a dynamic site myself.</p>\n<a href="https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/naoko-blog-design.png"><img /></a>My blog design between 2003-2019\n<h3>Translating WordPress</h3>\n<p>In November 2003, I re-launched my blog using WordPress. In December, I learned that there was a person named Otsukare who made a Japanese version of WordPress. This fork of WordPress, called “WordPress ME (Multilingual Edition)”, had the first comprehensive WordPress resource site in Japanese, with documentation Wiki and phpBB forums. Through the forum, I started helping him with translating documentation from English to Japanese.</p>\n<p>WordPress stayed as a relatively minor blog tool/CMS in Japan for years, but that didn’t change the fact that it was a piece of software that I really enjoyed using. I kept <a href="http://wpdocs.osdn.jp/">translating Codex</a>, participated in <a href="https://naoko.blog/tag/theme-competition/">theme competitions</a>, and helping others on the forums. It was the first time for me to experience being part of an open source community and working together with people I’ve never met in person (and without being paid!).</p>\n<p>What kept me going was the feeling that I’m part of something bigger. I loved using WordPress, and it was exciting that I could help spread the word. WordPress community gave me a chance to work with people around the world — years before “remote work” was a universally recognized word. There were no free voice/video chat applications, no Slack, but the interpersonal connections have grown deeper because everyone in the community was centered around a tool to deliver your voices to others far from reach.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">WordPress Polyglots at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WCEU?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#WCEU</a> contributor day, translating to so many languages!

I vaguely remember my question &#8211; something like “I love WordPress, and I want to help spread it more in Japan. What should I do?” But I still clearly remember his answer.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“You should do a WordCamp.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Although it probably was just a casual suggestion since we happened to be at a WordCamp, that idea stayed with me. That short interaction was no doubt the initial trigger of our first WordCamp in Japan, a year later. I was living in the U.S., but that really didn’t matter. Japanese WordPress translators, developers, and users who knew each other through the forums and blogs all worked together to run <a href="https://ja.wordpress.org/2008/09/04/wordcamp-tokyo-2008/">WordCamp Tokyo 2008</a>.</p>\n<img />WordCamp Tokyo 2008. Photo credit: Odyssey\n<h3>Career and Leadership</h3>\n<p>My career also changed dramatically between 2006 and 2009.</p>\n<p>Because I gained general blog template customization skills through working with WordPress, freelance work started to come in. I also had the opportunity to write WordPress books in Japanese. Thanks to WordPress, I was able to learn and practice the idea of ​​Web Standards. My ability to write solid markups was valued, and I got my first full-time technical job as a frontend engineer at an ad agency in a suburb of Detroit.</p>\n<p>In April 2009, I started as a part-time Happiness Engineer (customer support for WordPress.com) at Automattic, then in 2010 offered a full-time position. Since then, my role had evolved into the field of localization, and I’m happy to tell you that my 10th anniversary is coming up soon.</p>\n<p>In the past few years, I’ve taken up some more global responsibilities within the WordPress community, such as one of the Global Mentors for the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/">Polyglots Team</a>, and lead organizer of <a href="https://wptranslationday.org/">WordPress Translation Day 4</a>. Most recently, I was selected as the global leader of the first WordCamp Asia (planned for 2020 in Bangkok, Thailand).</p>\n<h3>Growing and Giving Back</h3>\n<p>The WordPress community taught me so much.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keep making efforts in good faith and results will follow.</li>\n<li>It takes time to build trust.</li>\n<li>Everyone has the potential to grow.</li>\n<li>You can’t ignore diversity so might as well embrace it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sometimes the process of gaining such new insights was painful, but I still feel I’m lucky to have been given challenges that made me grow.</p>\n<p>To give back, I want to continue helping communities outside of the English speaking world. I believe that’s the most powerful thing I can do to remove the barriers on the web and the vast world that it touches.</p>\n<a

を通して成長できたという話</h2>\n<p>高野直子</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>WordPress のことを知ったのは、約16年前でした。</p>\n<p>その数カ月後には元持っていたブログを WordPress に切り替え、さらにまた数カ月後には現在も続いている WordPress への翻訳という形での貢献を始めることになりました。振り返ると、社会人になってからほとんどの年数を、WordPress とともに過ごしてきたわけです。</p>\n<p>私が現在東京で子育てをしながらグローバルかつ柔軟な環境で働くことができるのは、新しい世界を見せてくれ、機会を与えてくれた WordPress の存在のおかげです。</p>\n<p>今こうやって、「WordPress との関わりが自分と周りの『バリア』を破ったこと」というテーマで記事を書かせてもらうにあたって思いを巡らせてみると、本当にこのソフトウェアと出会わなければまったく違う人生を歩んでいただろうなと思います。多くの人たちにもめぐりあうことはなかっただろうし、仕事はもちろん、住んでもいる場所も違っていたかもしれない。</p>\n<p>そんな、私にとってとても大きな存在の WordPress が、迷える20代を過ごしていた自分をどんなふうに変えてくれたかのお話をしようと思います。</p>\n<h3>WordPress との出会い</h3>\n<p>私が WordPress を知ったのは、2003年の春か夏頃でした。その頃の私はというと、高校留学後にアメリカ中西部の地方大学でグラフィックデザインの学位を取ったものの、新卒で入った小さな会社がドットコムバブルで立ち行かなくなったり、当時の夫の大学院入学のためにアメリカに戻ってきても経験不足で Web 関係の仕事には就けなかったり。とは言え家計を支える立場を選んだわけで、一旦やりたかった仕事はあきらめて、日系自動車会社で派遣をやっていた日々でした。インハウス翻訳者兼事務補助職のような感じで、お給料と需要を優先して良く言えばがむしゃらにがんばっていたし、悪くいうと目の前のことでいっぱいいっぱいという状況。</p>\n<p>ただ、そのころ時間だけはたっぷりあったんです。夫は暇さえあれば勉強していたし、派遣の仕事もそんなに忙しいものではなかったので、定時に帰って夕食後はテレビを見たり出かけたりはせず、それぞれパソコンに向かっていました。</p>\n<p>趣味やフリーランスの制作者として細々と HTML 手打ちのサイトなんかも作っていたのですが、Web デザイナーが個人で発信する情報はその当時ブログを読むのが何より最新で、ワクワクするものでした。</p>\n<p>そこからいきなり WordPress をインストールしたわけではなくて、まずは一番簡単そうだった Blogger.com を触ってみて制限がちょっと多すぎると感じ、Movable Type をしばらく運用してあまり相性がよくないかもと感じた、というのが私のブログ作りのスタートでした。その後ぴったりなタイミングで b2 からフォークしたリリース版を出したばかりだった WordPress に出会いました。</p>\n<p>PHP のファイルを触りながら自分のブログを作っていく過程が本当に楽しくて、いつのまにか WordPress にハマっていました。そのころはシンプルな構成だったからというのはもちろんあるんですが、それまでほぼ HTML と CSS しか書いたことがなかった自分がいつのまにかそんなふうにいわゆる「動的」サイトを作れるようになっていくことに自分でも驚きました。</p>\n<h3>WordPress 翻訳を始める</h3>\n<p>2003年11月にブログエンジンの変更を完了したサイトを公開し、12月に日本語版の WordPress フォーク “WordPress ME (Multilingual Edition)” を公開しているサイトがあることを知りました。Otsukare さんというエンジニアが行なっていた日本語情報の発信や日本語フォーラムでの回答をお手伝いしているうち、1ユーザーからファンへ、そしてローカリゼーションという分野でのコントリビュートをするようになっていきました。</p>\n<p>それから何年も、WordPress は日本では比較的マイナーなブログツール/CMS ではあったんですが、自分の中では本当に大好きなソフトウェアで、地道に <a href="http://wpdocs.osdn.jp/">Codex</a> の翻訳をしたり、<a href="https://naoko.blog/tag/theme-competition/">テーマ作成コンテスト</a>に応募したり、フォーラムで回答したりしていました。オープンソースという世界も、会ったこともない人たちと（お金にならない！）作業を一緒にするのも初めてでしたが、WordPress を通して会う人たちは本当に様々で、固定観念を覆してくれた気がします。留学や在米で「世界」を分かった気になっていたけど、それよりも私にとって理解を深めてくれたのは、英語を使ってアクセスすることができるようになった、多様な価値観が存在するオンラインのコミュニティでした。</p>\n<p>自分がブログを書くことが好きで、そのツールの成長に少しでも関われるという喜びが、飽きずにオープンソース活動を続けられた理由だった気がします。まだ「リモートワーク」なんて言葉も、動画チャットツールや Slack さえもない時期からオンラインで世界中の人達とコラボレーションする文化を持つ WordPress でしたが、遠く離れた人に考えを届られるブログというツールが中心にあったからこそ、コミュニティは深みを持って成長してきたし、人と人のつながりが構築されていったのだと思います。</p>\n<h3>WordCamp Tokyo の運営</h3>\n<p>2007年、サンフランシスコで開かれた WordCamp に遠征し、マットに声をかけました。「WordPress が好きで、日本でももっと広めるために何かできないかなと思ってるけど、どうしたらいいかな？」そんな内容だったと思います。質問の記憶はおぼろげですが、彼の答えは今でも覚えています。</p>\n<blockquote><p>「WordCamp やったらいいよ！（You should do a WordCamp.）」</p></blockquote>\n<p>たまたま WordCamp にいたからの思いつきから出た言葉だったのかもしれませんが、そのときの一言が印象的で、約1年後に日本初の WordCamp を実行するきっかけになったのは間違いありません。私自身は日本に住んでいなかったにも関わらず <a href="https://ja.wordpress.org/2008/09/04/wordcamp-tokyo-2008/">WordCamp Tokyo 2008</a> が実行できたのは、単なる言い出しっぺの私に「いいね！」と言って一緒に運営をしてくれた他の翻訳者、開発者、日本語版ユーザーの方々とのつながりがあったからでした。</p>\n<h3>キャリアへの影響</h3>\n<p>2006年～2009年には、自分のキャリアも大きく変わりました。</p>\n<p>WordPress にハマることで身につけたブログテンプレート一般のカスタマイズ能力でフリーランスの仕事が入ってきたり、WordPress の本を日本語で書く機会もいただきました。Web 標準の考え方に触れて実践することができたのも WordPress のおかげで、「普通に、きちんとマークアップが書ける」スキルを評価されて、ずっと前から入社したかったデトロイト郊外の会社でフロントエンドエンジニアとしての経験を積むこともできました。その後、2009年にお声がけをいただき、Automattic でのカスタマーサポート職としてスタートして、2010年からフルタイムでこの会社の「社員」となり、現在はローカリゼーション関連のチームでプロジェクト管理を担当しています。もうすぐ勤務10年を迎えます。</p>\n<p>回り回って今は<a href="https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/">翻訳チーム</a>のグローバルメンターや、<a href="https://wptranslationday.org/">WordPress Translation Day</a> 4のリードオーガナイザーを任せてもらったり、そして自分でも驚くことに第一回 WordCamp Asia（2020年、バンコクにて開催予定）のグローバルリードにも選んでいただきました。</p>\n<h3>学びとお返し</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>誠実に努力を積み重ねていくことが実を結ぶ。</li>\n<li>信頼を築くには時間がかかる。</li>\n<li>誰にでも大きく成長できる可能性がある。</li>\n<li>多様性は必然。容認してしまうしかない。</li>\n</ul>\n<p>こういうことは当たり前のようでいて、実感できないような環境も少なくないのではないでしょうか。WordPress コミュニティだって常にパーフェクトではもちろんないにしろ、この場所ではそんな「当たり前」が大事されている、と私はよく感じます。みんなが納得できる普遍的な正しさが、長期的な視点での深みのあるコミュニティの維持と成長に欠かせない要素だと理解している人が多いからなのかなと思っています。</p>\n<p>自信も経験も少なかった自分にたくさんのことを学ばせてくれた WordPress と、その周りにいる人たちへの恩返しも込めて、これからさらに英語圏以外のコミュニティも手助けしていければと思っています。そうすることで、Web と世界を少しでも良い場所にできると信じているし、関わる多くの人のバリアを取り除くきっかけとなるはずです。</p>\n<div class="rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right

are one of the few remaining community centers where people freely pass on valuable skills to neighbors young and old. In addition to offering free access to books, computers, and the internet, libraries often host educational classes as a public service, with an emphasis on teaching fundamental skills for navigating the digital world. </p>\n<p>Many people who are on fixed incomes or living paycheck to paycheck cannot afford to have internet service at home. For them, the library is a gateway to online communication, job hunting, and learning new skills.</p>\n<p>Over the past five years, using WordPress has become one of those important skills, as the software is now used by 33% of the top 10 million websites, across nearly every major industry. </p>\n<p>Packed into a full schedule of toddler story time, book chats, and knitting groups, the public library in Loveland, Colorado, is hosting a free workshop called <a href="https://lovelandpubliclibrary.org/event/wordpress-websites-t2-19/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Getting Started with a WordPress Website</a> on May 22, 2019, from 9:00 AM – 10:30 AM MDT. Participants will learn the history and terminology of WordPress, along with the step-by-step basics of creating a website. Topics include posts vs pages, using media, installing a theme, and using plugins. </p>\n<p>Participants who cannot attend in person at the library can register online for a free ticket on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/353235661970837/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Facebook</a> or through <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/wordpress-websites-t2-19-tickets-59360407577?aff=efbeventtix&fbclid=IwAR18MOc21IlInUmdK3JRXPdXDMT8FPMkE4kYw5ltMpTyNsR47kWSWE3CZQY" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Eventbrite</a>. Those participating remotely will need to install the Adobe Connect meeting browser plugin and will be able to listen to the lecture through the digital classroom and ask questions via chat.</p>\n<p>Another class will be hosted July 2, 2019, for those who are unable to attend the May workshop.</p>\n<p>Loveland Public Library is one of many libraries that host free WordPress classes. Skokie Public Library in Skokie, Illinois, will be hosting a <a href="https://skokielibrary.info/events/10377/build-a-website-with-wordpresscom" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Build a Website with WordPress.com</a> workshop on Friday, May 24, and the Denver Public Library offers <a href="https://www.denverlibrary.org/ctc/wordpress-com-i" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">similar courses for WordPress.com</a> in various locations.

These are just a small sampling of the educational opportunities offered in this format.

What began as a block visibility management plugin has grown to include more features aimed at tweaking various settings in the editor. </p>\n<p><a href="https://jeffreycarandang.com/editorskit-1-5/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Version 1.5</a> adds some text, heading, and paragraph styling and formatting options that aren&#8217;t currently available in core. For example, Gutenberg lets users change the background color and text color for an entire paragraph, but that&#8217;s where the color customizations end. EditorsKit now supports highlighting a section of text or a heading and choosing a color or background color.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This may seem like a niche request to implement but Carandang has <a href="https://github.com/phpbits/block-options/issues/9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tracked</a> nearly two dozen related issues and discussions where users are asking for text highlighting or similar features. </p>\n<p>This release also adds underline and justify alignment options to the paragraph block. Gutenberg doesn&#8217;t include it by default, as <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-7-removes-the-underline-and-justify-buttons-from-the-editor" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WordPress 4.7 removed the justify button from the TinyMCE editor</a> in 2016. However, the demand for justified text has not disappeared.</p>\n<p>In adding the format to EditorsKit, Carandang <a href="https://github.com/phpbits/block-options/issues/10#issuecomment-493672412" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cited 10 issues</a> from Gutenberg&#8217;s GitHub repository and eight WordPress.org support topics where users have asked for the justify text option or have commented on it being missing. </p>\n<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Gutenberg-justify-underline-formats.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Those who have Jetpack installed will already have the justify alignment option. Carandang plans to add a check for wpcom/justify to the next release so users of both plugins won&#8217;t have two justify options.</p>\n<p><a href="https://jeffreycarandang.com/editorskit-1-5/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">EditorsKit 1.5</a> tackles the widespread issues with Gutenberg&#8217;s autosave function by adding a toggle that allows users to enable/disable it. This setting can be found under the vertical ellipses menu at the top of the editor.<br />\nUsers have <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/9220" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> getting stuck in autosave, particularly with slower connection speeds, and some have experienced problems with their hosts. </p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Neat. I’ve seen users leave their browser tab open all night and their session expires, but the autosaves continue to post even though it’s now getting a 403. Then when the person wakes up their server blacklisted their IP.</p>\n<p>&mdash; Jay (@wpdevlife) <a href="https://twitter.com/wpdevlife/status/1123209118246944768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 30, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>As the result of getting stuck in autosave, users often attempt to refresh the screen only to lose the work. This has been an ongoing problem since last year. EditorsKit gives users the option to turn autosave off if they are experiencing problems and save manually as they see fit.</p>\n<p>Version 1.5 adds theme support for changing the block width to match the page template and layout. This allows theme developers to customize block sizes based on the template the users selects.</p>\n<p>Carandang has been adding new features based on his own needs but has found most of them to be fairly common requests in the Gutenberg repository. He made upcoming features and ideas for EditorsKit <a href="https://github.com/phpbits/block-options/issues" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">public on GitHub</a> and is accepting feature suggestions in this format. A few of his current ideas under discussion include: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>a React emoji picker</li>\n<li>copy link icon for the top bar of the editor</li>\n<li>to-do style using checkbox and strike through</li>\n<li>Markdown support for RichText API</li>\n<li>uppercase and indent formats</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I asked Carandang if he has any plans to add an option for paring down Gutenberg to the bare essentials with an interface more focused on writing. He said it is a possibility but is optimistic that the Gutenberg team may work to solve this common complaint in core.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve thought of that, specially when my writer colleague asked me about it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But I think it&#8217;s not time for that yet. I&#8217;ll wait for more Gutenberg releases before deciding if it&#8217;s needed in EditorsKit.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Carandang said he doesn&#8217;t plan to add any custom blocks to EditorsKit. His goal is to extend blocks for users to have options that they can utilize globally, while using whichever blocks plugin(s) they prefer. The plugin currently has no revenue model but he may pursue monetization in the future.</p>\n<p>&#8220;At of the moment, I&#8217;m more focused on building the plugin features rather than monetization, but extensions may come in a year or two when Gutenberg is more stable,&#8221; Carandang said. </p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 21 May 2019 14:58:57 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:89:"WPTavern: CoBlocks 1.9.5 Merges Block Gallery Plugin into Collection, Adds New Form Block";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=89869";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:99:"https://wptavern.com/coblocks-1-9-5-merges-block-gallery-plugin-into-collection-adds-new-form-block";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4217:"<p><a href="https://coblocks.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CoBlocks</a>, a collection of page builder blocks that was recently <a href="https://wptavern.com/godaddy-acquires-themebeans-coblocks-block-gallery-and-block-unit-tests" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">acquired by GoDaddy</a>, has added four new blocks in version 1.9.5. This is the first major release since the plugin was acquired from Rich Tabor and his co-creators. Tabor now heads up a WordPress Experience team at GoDaddy where CoBlocks&#8217; development continues.</p>\n<p>This release merges the three gallery blocks (Masonry, Stacked, and Carousel) from the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/block-gallery/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Block Gallery</a> plugin into CoBlocks. There is a migration path for users to convert their existing Block Gallery blocks to CoBlocks&#8217; gallery blocks. Block Gallery is still available on WordPress.org as a separate plugin with 5,000 active installs, which is actually more installs than CoBlocks (4,000). Tabor said his team is still discussing whether or not it will remove the plugin in the future.</p>\n<p>&#8220;CoBlocks is already a suite of blocks that level-up the block editor, bringing in those gallery blocks into the core plugin removes a barrier for folks who already have CoBlocks installed,&#8221; Tabor said. &#8220;Instead of folks having to install, activate, and maintain two plugins &#8211; only one is needed. On top of that, it’s far easier to maintain them collectively under one roof, as many of the components are shared between the two plugins.&#8221; </p>\n<p>In addition to merging the gallery blocks, CoBlocks 1.9.5 introduces a new Form block that allows users to customize a simple form directly within the editor. The block includes name, email, and message form fields but does not offer the ability to create new fields or change them to different types of fields. Users can set any of the fields as required using a toggle inside the block preview. For anything beyond these capabilities, a dedicated forms plugin would be required.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-20-at-7.13.40-PM.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>CoBlocks 1.9.5 also adds official support for Gutenberg 5.7 and includes more than a dozen tweaks and fixes. </p>\n<p>Tabor said his team is identifying further solutions that can be leveraged to make page building in WordPress more simple. CoBlocks is rapidly becoming a another one-stop shop for the mostly commonly used page building blocks. </p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re looking at how to make adding maps easier (a better Map block) and developing a system that enables restaurants to build out menus,&#8221; Tabor said.</p>\n<p>Several other block collections already offer a map block and/or a similar suite of page building functionality, such as <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/ghostkit/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ghost Kit</a>, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/atomic-blocks/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Atomic Blocks</a>, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/stackable-ultimate-gutenberg-blocks/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Stackable</a>, and <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/editor-blocks/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Editor Blocks</a>. Collections seem to be the best way to offer multiple small UI elements, especially if they are all designed to be complimentary in style. Plugin authors differentiate their collections from the others with additional block options, support, complimentary themes, and immediate compatibility with the Gutenberg plugin. </p>\n<p>At the moment, there is little incentive for developers to maintain functionality as separate plugins, but WordPress&#8217; planned single <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-explores-proposal-for-new-block-directory-to-host-single-block-plugins" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">block directory</a> may change the way blocks are packaged for optimal discovery. For now, it&#8217;s a race to see which block collection can offer the most useful suite with the most intuitive UI. </p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 21 May 2019 00:57:04 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:66:"WPTavern: WordPress 5.2 Improves the Security of Automatic Updates";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=89913";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:77:"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-2-improves-the-security-of-automatic-updates";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4791:"<p><a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-2-jaco-released-includes-fatal-php-error-protection-and-a-recovery-mode">WordPress 5.2</a>, released earlier this month, added the first step towards fully secure updates with offline digital signatures. Scott Arciszewski, Chief Development Officer for Paragon Initiative Enterprises, <a href="https://paragonie.com/blog/2019/05/wordpress-5-2-mitigating-supply-chain-attacks-against-33-internet"></a><a href="https://paragonie.com/blog/2019/05/wordpress-5-2-mitigating-supply-chain-attacks-against-33-internet">explains</a><a href="https://paragonie.com/blog/2019/05/wordpress-5-2-mitigating-supply-chain-attacks-against-33-internet"> how it works</a> and how developers can migrate away from mcrypt to libsodium.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>When your WordPress site installs an automatic update, from version 5.2 onwards, it will first check for the existence of an <code>x-content-signature</code> header. </p><p>If one isn&#8217;t provided by the update server, your WordPress site will instead query for a <code>filenamehere.sig</code> file.</p><p>No matter how it&#8217;s delivered, the signatures are calculated using <a href="https://latacora.micro.blog/2018/04/03/cryptographic-right-answers.html#asymmetric-signatures">Ed25519</a> of the SHA384 hash of the file&#8217;s contents. The signature is base64-encoded for safe transport.</p><cite>Scott Arciszewski</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress core development team manages the signing or secret keys. WordPress 5.2 contains a signing key that expires on April 1, 2021. The verification key or public key is used to decipher the secret key. This value determines the validity of the signature. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the feature is still in an experimental phase, WordPress 5.2 <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39309#comment:85">allows an update to occur</a> if a soft error or invalid signature is encountered. This is to prevent more severe errors from causing the user to be locked out of the update process until a manual update is applied. The team will use the reported error information to improve the signature checking process. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The digital signatures are only supported for core updates with Themes and Plugins to follow in a later release. It&#8217;s also likely that the team will include separate keys for core releases, plugins, themes, translations, etc. to allow for more fine-grained control. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Digital signatures applied to WordPress core updates is an important milestone because it prevents users from unknowingly downloading updates from malicious sources. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, without digital signatures, if the server or servers that house the core update files were compromised, a false update could be sent to millions of sites. In 2016, WordFence <a href="https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2016/11/hacking-27-web-via-wordpress-auto-update/">explained how this scenario could play out</a> when they publicized a security vulnerability they discovered with api.wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Persistence Pays Off</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In early 2017, Arciszewski <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170214062414/https://medium.com/@CiPHPerCoder/stopmullware-on-the-security-of-27-of-the-websites-on-the-internet-298a7e5b6871">published a plea</a> to Matt Mullenweg to focus on securing WordPress&#8217; automatic updates system by using secure cryptographic signatures. Mullenweg responded to the article with <a href="https://medium.com/@photomatt/wordpress-and-update-signing-51501213e1">one of his own</a> on Medium. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We will at some point; as said above it’s a good idea — can’t hurt, might help.

Four months ago, Gary Pendergast, WordPress core developer, <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39309#comment:53">responded to the ticket</a> saying that the feature fell in line with the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/12/08/9-priorities-for-2019/">list of WordPress priorities</a> planned for 2019 and beyond.

The project&#8217;s previous versions used Ubuntu 14, which has now reached end of life (EOL). </p>\n<p>Support for VVV 2 is now discontinued, due to an unforeseen complication with its PHP dependencies. Ondřej Surý, who maintains all the PHP packages VVV uses, deleted the unsupported ones in response to Ubuntu 14 reaching EOL. VVV contributors had set up a package mirror but only 70% of them were mirrored. As a result, VVV 2 installs were no longer able to provision. VVV maintainers have stopped supporting it and it will not receive any fixes or updates in the future. </p>\n<p><a href="https://tomjn.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tom Nowell</a> said he and his fellow VVV maintainers had &#8220;a mini- Ubuntu 14-apocalypse of sorts when it reached EOL,&#8221; so the new Ubuntu 18 box is a big bump up that should cover the project until 2024. It includes Kernel improvements that make Ubuntu faster when used in a virtual machine. The 3.0 update came out of necessity but it includes changes the team had already intended to make.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We wanted to move from 14 to 18 for a long time anyway, and Anton Vanyukov had written a PR starting that, so we went ahead,&#8221; Nowell said. &#8220;The internals are based on VVV 2 so 99% of things should still work exactly the same (but a bit better and a little faster).&#8221; </p>\n<p>VVV now uses a leaner custom built box, but it requires users to destroy their VMs in order to update. Directions for updating to 3.0 are in the release <a href="https://varyingvagrantvagrants.org/blog/2019/05/15/vvv-3-0-0.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">post</a>. This destroys the database but VVV creates its own backups that can be quickly restored with a simple command.</p>\n<p>Another major change in 3.0 is that VVV no longer stores MariaDB data inside the VM. The data has been relocated to database/data, which has the added benefit of being preserved when using the <code>vagrant destroy</code> command.</p>\n<p>The release also includes quite a bit of restructuring with the removal of the /vagrant mapped folder that eliminates overlapping vagrant shared folders. In addition to several dozen smaller improvements, VVV 3.0 adds a new teddy bear when it finishes provisioning.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screenshot-2019-05-17-at-14.51.27.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<h3>The Future of VVV: Version 4 to Focus on User-Friendly Improvements to Provisioning</h3>\n<p>Although VVV doesn&#8217;t yet have a user-friendly interface and requires the use of a terminal, Nowell said the team is working towards making it easier to use. For now, VVV distinguishes itself from other development apps, like Local and DesktopServer, by being a community project that is free from commercial interests.</p>\n<p>&#8220;VVV does a lot of the things DesktopServer does but for free,&#8221; Nowell said. &#8220;We don’t charge $99 for PHP7, SSL, or WP CLI. VVV won’t up sell you on hosting either, and you can have as many sites as you want out of the box.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A lot of people like Local for using Docker containers, but all those containers are inside a boot2docker virtual machine using VirtualBox. They have a pretty UI, and it’s great if you use FlyWheel as a host, but it’s not the easiest to get set up for contributing to WordPress.&#8221;</p>\n<p>VVV has a specific pre-built version that provides a development environment <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/tutorials/installing-a-local-server/installing-vvv/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">optimized for contributing to WordPress core</a>. It can be copied onto a USB drive and set up on a user&#8217;s machine, even while offline. This pre-built version is often handed out at the beginning of contributor days at WordCamps.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We’re a community driven project,&#8221; Nowell said. &#8220;People going to contributor days use VVV &#8211; the entire package can be pre-built and put on a USB stick and it runs in a lot more places than some of the docker based setups that some devs use. Until recently you needed to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro to be able to use Docker on Windows. Imagine 100 contributors downloading Windows 10 iso files over conference wifi.&#8221;</p>\n<p>VVV maintainers and contributors are working on releasing version 3.1 in the next month with all the little things they want to polish. Nowell said they have the basis for what they want to accomplish in version 4. Instead of waiting for VVV to install and configure PHP/MySQL/nginx/etc, the install process will happen on a server somewhere and the user will be able to just download the result, similar to how VVV is pre-built for contributor days.</p>\n<p>Nowell identified the major impacts of taking this approach:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It doesn’t matter if provisioning works for you, we’re doing that for you.</li>\n<li>If someone makes a big slip up, that’s ok, users get the last working build and see nothing.</li>\n<li>Getting everything set up should be much much faster, it will remove about 70-80% of the startup time for a lot of users.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Nowell said the general goal is to &#8220;just make it more fun to use&#8221; but his personal goal is for people to be able to use VVV without ever touching a terminal. He thinks it can be done with an <a href="https://electronjs.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Electron</a> wrapper and has performed a few experiments with it. In the past, he spent a lot of time improving the messaging for provisioning errors, but the days of trying to preempt those problems may soon be drawing to a close.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Why fix provisioning for users if they never have to do it in the first place?&#8221; Nowell said. &#8220;I’d say VVV 4 will come pre-built so it only builds the sites themselves, like how you can grab a docker image with PHP/MySQL already setup, and fill it with a site. Eventually the dashboard itself can become an Electron app where you can turn VVV on/off and adds sites.&#8221;</p>\n<p>VVV maintainers have some ambitious plans for version 4 that will make it available to a wider population of WordPress users and save existing users more time on startup. The project needs more testers and feature requests. Contributions to the main project are <a href="https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">welcome on GitHub</a>.

During setup of the fieldgroup, I had also the choice to display form controls in the Block Options tab in the sidebar. For the moment, I have determined that’s it’s just personal preference. Once you click outside the block, the form disappears and the block is rendered similar to its frontend representation.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/49oYuT1N3zL8kgT0ojON3E5s4RgJlS9wJHou2fwgUAGEwaP0LOyuuQ4DZmTm2EUpcHJXRluW_tFlvj_coY62gTteq6ep1kJKTrUTR7lbuV5w276LNlxGJikJwdY51KPvVeyBB5Mh" alt="" />\n\n\n\n<p>Now that I have the block finalized, I can add more team members to the page. I decided, I’d like them in a column block with two columns. </p>\n\n\n\n<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/XgDmfWQFlv6oN12gTeoZ9wA4JN0lvf_FGeWTLK3RfmWfAKXjQ9E_GOvY5kTKDPJRyAcSP36u1VTMkGI5kwiZ8mUQJnCKQSKYZdE-G6io645EsTyp2V4CfMXrCotH8Och1vGEWUjK" alt="" />\n\n\n\n<p>So far, so good. I was not thrilled that the location of the template points to the theme folder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I want to switch out the theme, I still would like to keep the block and the layout for the block with my site, so I would need to make sure to copy the blocks folder to the new theme’s directory. Another way is outlined in the &nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/getblocklab/block-lab/wiki/3.-Displaying-custom-blocks">documentation for Blocklab on Github</a>. It offers two filters to change the default location of the template: </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“To use a different template inside your theme, use the block_lab_override_theme_template( $theme_template ) filter. </em><em>To use a different template outside your theme (for example, in a plugin), use the block_lab_template_path( $template_path ) filter.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was fairly easy to set up, even if you are not a PHP developer, you can probably use the one PHP function block-field() and make sure to reference the right field names. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Block Lab, in essence, provides you with a method to create the fields and configure the block properties in one screen, and then you need to add the corresponding block template to a folder /blocks/ in your theme’s directory.  It&#8217;s fairly straight forward. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Creating a Team Block with ACF 5.8 </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>ACF (Advanced Custom Fields) version 5.8 came out with a block builder (only available in the Pro version). For my test I used ACF 5.8 RC 1. The final release is available now.  Elliot Condon is the plugin’s author and the first version was released in 2011. The plugin has grown into a hugely popular developer tool for freelancers and agencies alike and has over 1 million installs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Its success and versatility make the creation of the field group a more involved process compared to the other two plugins. The Pro version 5.8 contains the first release of its block building tool.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the admin view of the Field group “Team Member”. </p>\n\n\n\n<img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/63PvvK9vJx7T38CSlED8q91thMJh3qToA1bGuKDmBaQQGNsEDndfT4z1KkFFx9fISlt8pnWfq6lrnnoAy11YKmlhXiz-GmydV7sB91YorPT5QGfI46CEWLzY22sfsS-krFn_Aa-1" alt="" />\n\n\n\n<p>Now how do I make this into a block? <a href="https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/blocks/">The documentation</a> is comprehensive enough. &nbsp;Note: In this test I went in a slightly different order… </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started with the Field Group and I needed to get back to that admin screen after I registered the block (see below) .</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I &nbsp;used two files. First, I needed to register the block in the <em>functions.php</em> of my theme. For the template/block rendering code I used <em>content-block-team-member.php</em> also to be stored in the active theme’s folder. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You will see how those two fit together in a second. The rest of the work is done by the plugin in the back end.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>So let’s write the Block Code in PHP</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The first snippet is the block registration. I gave it a name, title, a description, point to the render template, give it a category, an icon and some keywords, under which the content producer can find the block in the Block Inserter. I scrolled all the way to the end of my theme’s <em>functions.php</em> and added this snippet:</p>\n\n\n<pre class="brush: php; title: ; notranslate">\nfunction register_acf_blocks() {\n   // register a team member block.\n   acf_register_block(array(\n       \'name\'              =&gt; \'acf-team-member\',\n       \'title\'             =&gt; __(\'ACF Team Member\'),\n       \'description\'       =&gt; __(\'A custom team member block created via ACF 5.8\'),\n       \'render_template\'   =&gt; \'content-block-team-member.php\',\n       \'category\'          =&gt; \'formatting\',\n       \'icon\'              =&gt; \'admin-comments\',\n       \'keywords\'          =&gt; array( \'team member\', \'team\' ),\n   ));\n}\n// Check if function exists and hook into setup.\nif( function_exists(\'acf_register_block\') ) {\n   add_action(\'acf/init\', \'register_acf_blocks\');\n}\n</pre>\n\n\n<p>This code is straight from the <a href="https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/blocks/">documentation</a> and I just changed a few values. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the next section I created the block rendering template. The file name needs to match the “render_template” attribute in the above text, which is “<strong>content-block-team-member.php</strong>”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also just followed <a href="https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/blocks/#key-concepts">along ACF’s documentation</a> and only changed a few values and updated the display code. </p>\n\n\n<pre class="brush: php; title: ; notranslate">\n&lt;pre class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code"&gt;&lt;?php\n// create id attribute for specific styling\n$id = \'team-member\' . $block[\'id\'];\n\n// create align class ("alignwide") from block setting ("wide")\n$align_class = $block[\'align\'] ? \'align\' . $block[\'align\'] : \'\';\n\n// Load values and asigning defaults for the block fields.\n$short_bio = get_field(\'short_bio\') ?: \'the short bio goes here... \';\n$first_name = get_field(\'first_name\') ?: \'First Name\';\n$last_name = get_field(\'last_name\') ?: \'Last Name\';\n$image = get_field(\'picture\');\n$email_address = get_field(\'email_address\');\n$extension = get_field(\'extension\');\n?&amp;gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;" class="team-member "&amp;gt;\n       &lt;h2&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;\n   &lt;blockquote class="team-member-blockquote"&gt;\n   &lt;img class="teamphoto"&gt;" alt="" alt="  " width="150" style="float:left;padding:4px;margin;2px;"/&amp;gt;\n       &lt;span class="team-member-short-bio"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n       &lt;br /&gt;\n       &lt;span class="team-membe-extension"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n       &lt;span class="team-membe-email-address"&gt;\n       &lt;/span&gt;\n   &lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/pre&gt;\n</pre>\n\n\n<p>As I started with the Fieldgroup, I needed to go back and make sure that the group is associated with the block I just registered. &nbsp;Below the Fieldgroup screen I created a rule for the Location: It needs to read:  “Show this field group if the <strong>Block</strong> is equal to <strong>ACF Team Member. &nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/dNTCzxoXnT8IKlgMBkZKhhcKAyuj6AyZVF5wRHn4rhKGEPt4MTBkmR5rkyxLk_Nl1RZAaiU_sMDplVlmRcVJz7b6xjcbgmEJ0tAJVHllcNzJzEuqUQhUhzwvxFD1-pd8Ahhp28FR" alt="" />\n\n\n\n<p>Now let’s see how this works in the Block editor when I add two members. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>It was an interesting experience. You can use the form in the editor section to enter the data. Another option is to enter the data in the form fields available in the the sidebar and you see the block update in real time. You can toggle between the two methods but clicking on the Button “Switch to Edit” or “Switch to Preview” depending which method you are using right now. </p>\n\n\n\n<img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/uihtOmYm4w4yeWo3F116ZTzgr7ESRlgTpOOeOgrI_IWXM4QMJIzs-tjOSnt0o1rnp0EQPIUZE990pMCDvGgjDXS8LhkxBFHAgZnGYZhwYO_DObXU51wuwZcfWOUX_DlMXIJy8Y5E" alt="" />\n\n\n\n<p>The block editor UI works well. It’s worth going through the more elaborate setup and code necessary. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Creating a Team Block with Lazy Blocks</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The third plugin in this test is called “Lazy Blocks” by Nikita of nkdev.info, the same team that also published the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/ghostkit/">GhostKit</a> block collection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It not only allows me to store information in post_content but I also get a choice to store it in the post_meta table. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is a video of using the interface to create the fields.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>As this admin screen is focused on getting all the information to create the blocks, on the left I created my fields and in the sidebar. &nbsp;I filled in the information needed to register a block with the editor. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Underneath,  I was  able to add the HTML for frontend and backend. The syntax is even easier than Block Lab, and of course much easier than ACF’s  templating. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I didn’t need to add any code to my theme’s functions.php nor did I need to create additional files with my template code. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can add it all right here, aided by syntax highlighting and merge tags rather than function calls. &nbsp;The <a href="https://lazyblocks.com/documentation/getting-started/">documentation shows multiple ways</a> to write your template code. I am definitely a fan of <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/">Handlebars (semantic templating)</a> as it is in this context much closer to other systems’ merge tags. </p>\n\n\n\n<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/n048DkWcRrFC5Z6Y17GgeTYrL_mIMfARYJt71-S7aZx-v6NIkL94QYIsvJr0eWk4pejhgQjBr5-QECpi16qRbQsXOOq_5HoDSN2qGlHejMr7kLfq9qNAeenG7xIjGhnOM6pCcXyp" alt="" />\n\n\n\n<p>I copy/pasted the same code into the “Editor HTML” tab, so I could see the frontend display below the form fields. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s use it. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Eqo6z_IfKoAahVP3pNl4TyDc1zAffiOUbLHD1H07DCevQORZkRC-9vyKh6jTFq3djhm840806ktf5PdkrARuCWyRvf0KFCpwHG3JyuHGfEUfMuhMkEkp-SOekYTt9ZDUAsSpS4_O" alt="" />\n\n\n\n<p>This seems to work. It was little bit awkward that the form didn’t disappear when I unselect the block. It takes up a lot of real estate in the editor. Although, I wanted to have the team members in a two-column block, I did not succeed in dragging and dropping the two blocks into a Column Block. I mentioned this in my <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/remove-form-when-block-is-not-selected/">support topic </a>and nK answered: “&#8230;hiding controls when the block is not selected is a good feature, that already added in ACF Blocks and will be added in Lazy Blocks soon.” Here you have it &#8211; all in due time. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion: Complex, Evolved, or Easy. &nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href="https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/"><strong>ACF 5.8</strong></a> &nbsp;has a very robust block building feature, and every one who has been using the plugin to build sites will be very happy to be able and create dynamic blocks for their customers. It’s well thought through, and developers of all skill sets will get up and running quickly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Someone, who is not well versed in PHP will have her fair share of trial and error to get it all going. It will get even more complicated when the requirements for the blocks get more involved and beyond this test’s use case. This is not a tool for WordPress beginners or DIY site implementers who don’t write a lot of code themselves. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, only the ACF 5.8 Pro version comes with the block builder feature. <a href="https://twitter.com/wp_acf/status/1112934364751396865">Condon is contemplating making it a stand alone plugin</a>. (See what the Twitteratti think about the idea… ) </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href="https://getblocklab.com/">Block Lab </a></strong>is in its early stages of development. It succeeds in abstracting most of the block architecture and reduces the amount of code that needs to be written. The documentation is very helpful. The template is stored in a separate file, and needs to be maintained with the rest of the theme files. If we at my company would use it for any of our projects, we would store the template file with one of our helper plugins, so our customers are able to switch themes without losing the content and display of the blocks built with Block Lab. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Pro version boasts additional features, such as repeater fields, import/export of blocks, user object fields, map field and many more block features. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>XWP is an agency working with enterprise clients on the WordPress.com VIP hosting and other corporations. Their team members are contributing to other big ideas in the WordPress space,<a href="https://xwp.co/project/customizer/"> including the Customizer</a>, &nbsp;<a href="https://xwp.co/project/google-amp/">AMP</a> and <a href="https://xwp.co/project/tide/">Tide</a>. I expect the plugin to stay around and grow with Gutenberg Phase 2 into a robust system for site implementers, agencies, and theme developers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href="https://lazyblocks.com/">Lazy Blocks</a></strong><a href="https://lazyblocks.com/"> </a>is a delight to set up and as mentioned, I am a fan of the <a href="https://handlebarsjs.com/">Handelbars</a> templating syntax. It’s easy to learn even for beginners, and with a little practice, a site owner would be able to create specific Gutenberg blocks for their site. The block handling in the editor although functioning, is a little clunky, as the display doesn’t switch between block select state and unselect state at the moment. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If there is a requirement of having additional fields for a page or a section of a post, Lazy Blocks is a great tool to prototype and get quickly from idea to proof of concept.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only caveat: I was not able to find out who the people are behind <em>nkdev.info</em> and the name Nikita. The website only reveals that it is a young company but nothing more. If you use the plugin, make sure you have Plan B in place just in case the developers abandon the plugin before it takes off. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>ACF 5.8 is quite complex; Block Lab is a very flexible and only semi-complex; and Lazy Blocks is adequately named and the easiest to use. None of them lets you get away without writing code, as each block needs some display output in HTML. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let me know what you think about these three block generating plugins. Also, if you found another plugin that allows you to build blocks without getting into Javascript, I want to know about it!

In 2019, Automattic now employs more than 900 people from 68 countries who have all worked in a distributed fashion since day one. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;With the Distributed podcast I wanted to take a closer look at how some of the most innovative companies and brilliant minds think about the future of work,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;Not just the binary questions of &#8216;remote work&#8217; vs. &#8216;office work,&#8217; but the wider spectrum of what’s possible and why it matters. How can we work better and smarter in the decades to come—and what’s the moral imperative driving our desire to change?&#8221;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first <a href="https://distributed.blog/podcast/">episode</a> of the podcast features <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.upwork.com/" target="_blank">Upwork</a> CEO <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/skasriel" target="_blank">Stephane Kasriel</a>, who  is deeply embedded in the labor market for remote work. His company offers a global platform for connecting businesses with freelancers. Upwork went public in 2018 and is expected to do more than $1.7 billion in business this year. Kasriel has a wealth of knowledge to share from his experience managing more than 1,100 remote freelancers in 500 cities, in addition to 400 on-site employees.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Our mission at this company is to create economic opportunities for people to have better lives, and the way we measure that is how much money goes into people&#8217;s pockets,&#8221; Kasriel said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both Mullenweg and Kasriel are passionate about seeing more companies embrace remote work and the first part of the podcast goes deeper into what is currently broken about work. Those living in big cities are often paid well for their talents and expertise but will spend a large portion of that money on the cost of living. Kasriel said he believes Upwork can be a &#8220;driving force in creating a better future&#8221; by championing remote work as the economic catalyst for improving working conditions across the globe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This distributed-company movement is the awakening of the tech industry [to the reality] that we are part of the problem,&#8221; Kasriel said. &#8220;Part of the reason why jobs have been destroyed in plenty of places in the country while all the new jobs were created in a small number of areas is because of tech.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who are curious about how CEOs and managers make distributed work a success, the first episode includes discussions on some of the more practical issues of managing a remote work force. Mullenweg and Kasriel discuss the challenges of working across timezones, strategies for improving communication and  preventing employees from feeling a sense of isolation, and managing productivity and performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The topics included in the episode are even applicable for smaller distributed companies that are just starting out. Kasriel shared tips on establishing a strong culture of employee satisfaction for both on-site employees and those working remotely, navigating conflict, integrating new employees into remote culture, and allowing people to &#8220;delocate&#8221; from on-site work. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After listening to this episode, I found that Mullenweg and Kasriel presented a compelling case that distributed work is not just a buzzword in the tech industry.  It is actually a movement with a powerful economic impact that is poised to change the world. Remote work also has the added benefit of creating opportunities for people who have a difficult time participating in the traditional labor market, effectively increasing the diversity of a company&#8217;s employees by offering a more inclusive model for working.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The podcast is produced by Mark Armstrong and the team at <a href="https://www.chartsandleisure.com/">Charts &amp; Leisure</a>.

The inflexibility of the Columns block has been a frustration for users since it was introduced, but this release makes progress on one of the most common requests.

I&#8217;ve made some software changes and am hopeful the audio quality in episode three is much better. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Stories Discussed:</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href="https://wptavern.com/the-most-common-wordpress-theme-development-mistakes-and-how-to-fix-them">The Most Common WordPress Theme Development Mistakes (and How to Fix Them)</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href="https://www.codeinwp.com/blog/best-countries-to-outsource-software-development/">10 Best Countries to Outsource Software Development, Based on Data</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href="https://torquemag.io/2019/05/wordpress-ecommerce-site/">4 Reasons You Should Choose WordPress for Your E-Commerce Site</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href="https://jetpack.com/2019/05/14/jetpack-7-3-1-maintenance-release/">Jetpack 7.3.1: Maintenance Release</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2019/05/14/proposal-to-modify-plugin-guidelines/">Proposal to Modify Plugin Guidelines</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The transcript is in Rich-Text format.

Brazilian developer Diego Haz launched his MIT-licensed open source project this week with a stable version 1.0 now available to the public.</p>\n<p>The toolkit offers offers composable, themeable, and accessible UI components that strictly follow <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WAI-ARIA 1.1</a> standards. Out of the box, Reakit manages focus and keyboard interactions for components that require them. </p>\n<p>&#8220;WAI-ARIA is hard,&#8221; Haz said. &#8220;Mostly because the spec is dense, confusing and incomplete. My goal with Reakit is not only to provide accessible components out of the box, but also to serve as an example so people can build their own accessible stuff from scratch.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">A year ago I left my job to dedicate myself to this open source project.</p>\n<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f389.png" alt="🎉" class="wp-smiley" /> Announcing Reakit v1 <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f389.png" alt="🎉" class="wp-smiley" /><br /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f449.png" alt="👉" class="wp-smiley" /> <a href="https://t.co/GbaNYa5rck">https://t.co/GbaNYa5rck</a></p>\n<p>This is the best project I’ve ever done in my 17 years of programming.

The core library is now unstyled by default and does not depend a CSS library. This makes it easier for developers to build UIs from scratch. Developers with specific presentational requirements can easily apply their own styles, instead of spending time having to overwrite a built-in set of styles.</p>\n<p>Those who don&#8217;t want to start from scratch can install a theme package like <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/reakit-theme-default" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reakit-theme-default</a>.

Since I had savings, I decided to focus on this project. But soon enough I&#8217;ll have to find another job. I&#8217;ll try to find companies where I can use Reakit so I can improve the library at the same time I&#8217;m building something with it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Not all companies prioritize accessibility in their React-based products. One reason is the expertise and passion for accessibility, paired with React skills, is hard to find.</p>\n<p>As <a href="https://wptavern.com/wpcampus-gutenberg-accessibility-audit-finds-significant-and-pervasive-accessibility-problems" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WPCampus&#8217; Gutenberg accessibility audit</a> demonstrated, making accessible web apps with React is challenging. Gutenberg is <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/05/15/whats-new-in-gutenberg-15th-may/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">making major improvements towards becoming more accessible</a> after the completion of the audit. This process has shown that leveraging accessibility expertise and baking it in from the beginning is crucial for writing accessible web apps. </p>\n<p>React is often, and perhaps unfairly, singled out as <a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/2019/02/25/accessibility-is-not-a-react-problem/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">having an accessibility problem</a>. The library isn&#8217;t known for making it easy, but it does provide <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/accessibility.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">accessibility documentation</a> and encourages developers to write semantic HTML. </p>\n<p>While there is no magical &#8220;do-it-for-me&#8221; library that can ensure an app&#8217;s accessibility, the Reakit toolkit gives developers a head start. The project is <a href="https://github.com/reakit/reakit" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">open to contribution on GitHub</a> and is also on Open Collective for those interested in <a href="https://opencollective.com/reakit" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">funding its development</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 15 May 2019 19:02:23 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:27:"HeroPress: I Found My Tribe";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:56:"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=2814";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:106:"https://heropress.com/essays/i-found-my-tribe/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=i-found-my-tribe";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:11646:"<img width="960" height="480" src="https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/051519-min-1024x512.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="Pull Quote: I don\'t just have WordPress acquaintences. I have WordPress friend. I have WordPress family." /><p>When I was a kid not a single girl said “I want to be a web designer when I grow up”. Mostly because there was no world wide web. There weren’t video games either, until I was in junior high school and Pong came out. Back when I was a kid, girls mostly thought about becoming teachers, nurses, ballerinas, and mothers. We weren’t encouraged to do “man” jobs. We definitely weren’t encouraged to pursue STEM careers.</p>\n<p>As a matter of fact, my high school guidance counselor told me that I should give up my dream of college and concentrate on being a stay-at-home mom. (It was 1987 and I was ranked 21/325 students in my graduating class.)</p>\n<p>I’ve always been a bit of a calculated rebel, so I didn’t heed her advice. Instead I started down a long path through academia that would eventually bring me here, to WordPress and the community that has become my tribe.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m often asked how I started my WordPress business. I would love to tell you a story about how I did a ton of research, met with mentors, found advisors, wrote a perfect business plan, crafted an amazing marketing plan, and launched according to a timeline all neatly written out (and using a project management app, of course).</p>\n<h3>It wasn&#8217;t like that at all.</h3>\n<p>At the time I started my business I had worked in higher education for over twenty years as an administrator in five different colleges, universities, and trade schools. I had a bachelor of arts degree in Religion and Philosophy, classical training in vocal performance, an MBA (in marketing, e-commerce, and information systems management), and coursework completed toward a doctorate in higher education administration.</p>\n<p>In June of 2013, I decided it was time to leave my job as an administrator in a local trade school. I hadn&#8217;t really been happy for a long while, and the timing was right financially for me to make a move. My plan was to take July off, use August to job search, then be employed by September.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Have you ever heard the phrase, &#8220;Men plan, God laughs&#8221;?</p></blockquote>\n<p>While it was still June, and within the two weeks’ notice I had given, I was afraid I might become bored. I thought I could make a little money doing some marketing, so I posted to my personal Facebook page that I would love to help out friends and family with social media or web design. The customers came out of the woodwork.</p>\n<h3>And just like that, I had a business.</h3>\n<p>I made many mistakes along the way, of course. I charged $300 for a website when I started ($500 for e-commerce). I paid my dues and learned the trade. I started attending WordPress meetups in Rochester. They were sporadic, at best, so when the organizer asked me if I would become the organizer, I jumped at the chance and got us on a regular schedule, with topics in advance and volunteer speakers.</p>\n<p>From there it was just a matter of time before I would attend my first WordCamp (Buffalo, 2014). Since then I’ve attended more than thirty camps, organized six, mentored five, and spoken at twenty.</p>\n<h3>I love WordPress. But I love the people even more.</h3>\n<p>I don’t just <em>love</em> WordPress. I <em>fell in love</em> with WordPress. The ease of use. The total control. I love that there’s always more to learn. I love that I can teach others how to use it. I love the events. I love the collaboration. I love the people.</p>\n<p>I don’t just have WordPress acquaintances. I have WordPress friends. I have a WordPress <em>family</em>.</p>\n<p>The first site I ever logged into was created for my best friend and me. We had just started a nonprofit organization and her husband built us a website. He made the structure, but we had to add the content. He emailed us our logins. I remember logging in like I had mistakenly been given the key to the castle and wasn’t really supposed to use it. I was afraid to click links. I was afraid to click “publish” or “update.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>I thought for sure I’d kill the whole site. But I didn’t.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I wrote. I added classes. I added pages. I added posts. We added a membership component and soon I was navigating that like a sailor in well-known waters. I was a great WordPress user, but I still didn’t understand the connection between purchasing a domain and having a WordPress site, so I called my friend’s husband.</p>\n<p>Rob and Christine had five kids and Christine worked evenings. When I asked Rob to teach me how to get from the domain purchase to having a site, a deal was struck: if I would cook dinner for their kids, he would teach me WordPress. I made spaghetti, purchased a domain and hosting, and I wrote 4 things down on a piece of paper:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Download WordPress from wordpress.org.</li>\n<li>Upload WordPress through FTP.</li>\n<li>Edit wp-config file (don’t forget to change the salt keys)</li>\n<li>Don’t use “admin” as the account name.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The rest I (miraculously) remembered. That was eight years and over 300 WordPress installations ago.</p>\n<h3>Which all led me to where I am now.</h3>\n<p>Getting up the courage to speak at WordCamp about a year after I started building sites was scary. I felt like an imposter. I was sure I would be “found out,” but I really did “know my stuff.” People were very complimentary about my talk, so I applied to more camps. I met more people. My friends teased me that I wanted to know all the “A-Listers” in WordPress. Others teased that I wanted to BE an A-Lister. What I really wanted was to learn as much as I could, share what I knew, and build a network.</p>\n<p>In 2017 I spoke at WordCamp Ottawa. It was there I built a connection with Jason Knill of GiveWP.com. I had used Give before, and I told him about how it worked for me. He asked if Give could write about the nonprofit site I had built to raise money to feed children in South Sudan. He interviewed me about it. At the end of our meeting I mentioned to Jason that “if you ever have an opening, I’d love to work for you.” Four and a half months later I started working full-time as the Head of Customer Success for Give.</p>\n<h3>What I love about my job.</h3>\n<p>In my role at Give I get to talk to people all over the world. I get to help them increase their fundraising, which in turn helps their organizations &#8211; most of which are nonprofits helping make the world a better place.</p>\n<p>With our WP Business Reviews plugin I get to work with businesses that are hoping to grow and succeed &#8211; just like I did when I started my freelance business.</p>\n<p>I get to build a team that helps us succeed by helping others succeed. I get to employ people locally in my small hometown outside of Rochester, NY.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I get to keep sharing my love of WordPress.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I continue to speak at WordCamps, mentor and teach locally, and organize my local WordPress Meetup and Technology Nonprofit Meetup. I love Slack, Facebook Groups, Facebook Messenger, and Twitter messages because they let me keep in touch with all of the wonderful people I meet in the community.</p>\n<h3>Mostly I love how WordPress has empowered me to do more and to be more.</h3>\n<p>I’ve spent most of my life trying to broaden my comfort zone.</p>\n<p>As you can probably tell, I have a pretty large comfort zone. Actually, I can’t remember the last time I saw the border of my comfort zone, because it’s that big; but it wasn’t always so. When I was a child I had a comfort zone the size of a postage stamp. I had to stand in it on one toe, like an uncoordinated ballerina trying to learn to go en pointe and failing miserably. I was timid and shy. I was afraid of everything.</p>\n<p>Then one day I decided to do something uncomfortable. I ran for 8th grade student council secretary. It didn’t occur to me that I might not win. I have no idea where that hubris came from. I figured, at that point, that I had just as good a chance as anybody else. I made posters. I gave a speech. And something amazing happened. <em><strong>I lost the election.</strong></em> I mean, I cataclysmically lost the election.</p>\n<p>Most people wouldn’t think that losing an election was amazing, but it was. It was amazing because I learned that I could step outside of my comfort zone, lose, and survive. I could still breathe. Still be me. It had changed me and my perceptions of myself. After that, instead of a postage stamp-sized comfort zone, I could put my foot down on the whole envelope.</p>\n<h3>It didn’t end there.</h3>\n<p>What I learned is that comfort zones are like concentric circles. A step outside doesn’t just stretch the zone to fit that footstep. Instead, it increases it exponentially. Where before you had a three-foot circle, now you have a six-foot circle, then twelve feet, then twenty-four feet, then before you know it, you won’t be able to see the edge of your zone because it’s so big.</p>\n<h3>WordPress helped me with that, too.</h3>\n<p>Instead of feeling like an imposter, the WordPress community embraced me and gave me the validation I needed to feel like I belonged.

Bear features a zen writing experience blended seamlessly with note-taking capabilities, a combination that landed the app an Apple Design Award in 2017.</p>\n<p>People use Bear for everything from taking notes to writing chapters for books. Many users also rely on the app for writing drafts for blogs they plan to publish on other platforms. This often requires multiple steps for copying and pasting content, especially when there is media or HTML included in the content.</p>\n<p>Two years ago, the app&#8217;s creators had WordPress publishing on their to-do list but it wasn&#8217;t yet a priority. They were reluctant to implement their own publishing tool with the WordPress APIs and preferred a solution that would rely on external apps. </p>\n<p>Things have changed in the past couple of years, as writing apps have more pressure to provide a frictionless connection to publishing capabilities in order to remain competitive. WordPress&#8217; market share has grown to be an estimated <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress/all/all" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">33% of the the top 10 million websites</a>. In fact, Bear recently <a href="https://blog.bear.app/2019/02/our-blog-has-a-new-home-and-some-new-perks/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">moved its blog off of Medium and over to WordPress</a> in February 2019. </p>\n<p>This week WordPress.com, maintainers of the open source WordPress mobile apps, and Bear <a href="https://blog.bear.app/2019/05/introducing-a-new-way-to-publish-bear-notes-to-wordpress-on-ipad-and-iphone/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> that they have collaborated on a solution that allows users to publish notes to WordPress blogs on iOS. Recent updates to both Bear and WordPress apps enable users to click the share icon on a note and see WordPress pop up as an option. The content is shared with all of its formatting, headings, lists, links, and media in tact.</p>\n<p><a href="https://cloudup.com/ciCXTmNNLfv"><img src="https://i1.wp.com/cldup.com/u5KnyhPiCg.gif?resize=400%2C710&ssl=1" alt="Bear screen recording" width="400" height="710" /></a></p>\n<p>The developers at Shiny Frog, makers of the Bear app, explained the solution they landed on for the WordPress integration:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We built an <a href="https://github.com/shinyfrog/TextBundle" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">open source library</a> for processing TextBundle files. <a href="http://textbundle.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">TextBundle</a> is an open standard for sharing plain text files that include attachments like photos. WordPress then worked to add TextBundle support to its iOS app. Bear hands your note off to WordPress as a TextBundle file, and WordPress converts it into a blog post.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Using an open standard like this allows other other developers to <a href="https://github.com/shinyfrog/TextBundle" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">build on top of it</a> to create their own integrations for other platforms. It also keeps the Bear app team from having to stay up to date with all the changes to APIs of multiple platforms.</p>\n<p>The new WordPress publishing integration works with any site you have in the WordPress mobile app for iOS, including both self-hosted and WordPress.com sites. Notes must begin with an H1 tag in order to have the blog post title automatically populated. Bear App users can start publishing to WordPress immediately after updating both apps to the latest versions released this week.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 14 May 2019 20:20:13 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:71:"Akismet: Version 4.1.2 of the Akismet WordPress Plugin is Now Available";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://blog.akismet.com/?p=2039";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:57:"https://blog.akismet.com/2019/05/14/akismet-plugin-4-1-2/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:885:"<p>Version 4.1.2 of <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/">the Akismet plugin for WordPress</a> is now available.

Currently, there are over 7000 themes in the directory, the most popular of which exceeds <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/oceanwp/">300,000 active installations</a>. (Not including Twenty____ Themes which are packaged with WordPress and have install counts in the millions.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before submitting your theme to the directory, it’s important to understand the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/">review process</a> first because if your theme doesn’t meet those requirements it can be rejected on the spot.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Themes that have 3 or more distinct issues may be closed as not-approved. However, theme authors may resubmit the theme once they’ve corrected the issues.</p><cite><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/required/">https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/required/</a></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Reviewers are on your side and want to see your theme go live, once it meets the standards required. If your theme has only minor issues preventing it being included in the directory, your reviewer will work with you to fix those. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, if your theme has too many issues it will be closed as not-approved. If you decide to fix the issues you can upload the theme again &#8211; but it will join the back of the queue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From my experience <a href="https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&status=approved&owner=DannyCooper&col=id&col=summary&col=reporter&col=status&col=resolution&col=time&col=changetime&order=owner&desc=1&report=12">reviewing over 100 themes</a> I’ve been able to identify the most common issues that prevent themes being approved. By sharing these with you in this article I’m hoping I can help you avoid getting stuck in the queue or rejected.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Uploading Your Theme</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When you upload a theme, it joins the queue to be reviewed. On average it will take two months for your theme to reach the front of the queue and receive its first review. All reviewers are volunteers with limited time available to complete reviews. A variety of factors can affect the wait time. When more people volunteer to review themes, the queue moves quickly. Conversely, when themes with a lot of issues are submitted it slows down the queue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By submitting a theme that meets all the requirements it makes the review process a lot smoother and ultimately your theme will be live sooner. In this guide, we are going to explore the most common issues that will keep your theme held up in the queue and prevent it from being approved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note: Theme authors that have a track record of submitting issue-free themes can apply to become &#8216;<a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-theme-review-team-launches-trusted-authors-program">Trusted Authors</a>&#8216;.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Naming Issues</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When you upload a theme, the first check that is performed is to see if the name is already taken. Frequently you will be told the name you&#8217;ve chosen is already taken, even if you can&#8217;t see a theme with that name in the directory. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>How could that be? The reason is that the test isn&#8217;t checking against just the directory, it&#8217;s checking against the entire WordPress ecosystem. If a theme has been released anywhere (Github, ThemeForest, etc.) and has over 50 active installations, that name will be unavailable to use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note: if you&#8217;ve released your theme elsewhere and accumulated 50+ installations, you can still use that name in the directory.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Unescaped Output</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Theme reviewers take security <strong>very</strong> seriously, there&#8217;s even a <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/theme-security/">dedicated resource</a>. An entire article could be written on writing secure themes, but in this section we are going to explore one aspect: escaping output.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unescaped output places users of your theme at risk. Here’s an example of an unescaped value ($title):</p>\n\n\n<pre class="brush: xml; title: ; notranslate">\n$title = get_option( \'my_custom_title\' );\necho \'&lt;h2&gt;\' . $title . \'&lt;/h2&gt;\';\n</pre>\n\n\n<p>The problem with the above is that while we know what type of value $title <strong>should</strong> be, a string, we have not checked if that is the case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If a hacker has managed to change the value of &#8216;my_custom_title&#8217; in the database, your theme will output that value. This presents a huge risk as they could replace the intended output with inline Javascript:</p>\n\n\n<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">\n    alert(\'This is dangerous\'); \n\n</pre>\n\n\n<p>The solution is to escape all output to ensure it only includes the type of data we are expecting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our example could be fixed like this:</p>\n\n\n<pre class="brush: php; title: ; notranslate">\n$title = get_option( \'my_custom_title\' );\necho \'&lt;h2&gt;\' . esc_html( $title ) . \'&lt;/h2&gt;\';\n</pre>\n\n\n<p>The downside to using esc_html is that it strips all HTML tags. If $title included bold or italics, for example:</p>\n\n\n<pre class="brush: php; title: ; notranslate">\n$title = \'This article is &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; useful\';\necho esc_html( $title );\n</pre>\n\n\n<p>The word &#8216;very&#8217; would not be bold on the frontend; instead it would output the code &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This illustrates why it&#8217;s important to use the correct escaping functions for the context. If we were expecting some HTML in the output, we&#8217;d be better using wp_kses_post() or wp_kses() and setting the $allowed_html parameter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Functions that output also need to be escaped:</p>\n\n\n<pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate">\n&lt;a href="&lt;?php echo esc_url( get_permalink() ); ?&gt;"&gt;\n</pre>\n\n\n<p>The exception is WordPress core functions that include &#8216;the_&#8217; in their name, these are usually escaped already.</p>\n\n\n<pre class="brush: php; title: ; notranslate">\nfunction the_permalink( $post = 0 ) {\n    /**\n     * Filters the display of the permalink for the current post.\n     *\n     * @since 1.5.0\n     * @since 4.4.0 Added the `$post` parameter.\n     *\n     * @param string      $permalink The permalink for the current post.\n     * @param int|WP_Post $post      Post ID, WP_Post object, or 0. Default 0.\n     */\n    echo esc_url( apply_filters( \'the_permalink\', get_permalink( $post ), $post ) );\n}\n</pre>\n\n\n<h3><strong>Untranslatable Text</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To be accepted into the directory all themes must be 100% &#8216;translation-ready&#8217;. That means each text string your theme outputs must be translatable. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress already has the systems and functionality to handle the translation process, you just need to make sure your strings use the correct functions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While simple to implement, this is often overlooked as it goes against the flow of how people write HTML.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Normally, you might do something like this:</p>\n\n\n<pre class="brush: php; title: ; notranslate">\n&lt;h1&gt;404 - Not Found&lt;/h1&gt;\n</pre>\n\n\n<p>To make it translatable, you need to add in some PHP:</p>\n\n\n<pre class="brush: php; title: ; notranslate">\n// __ functions are the basis of localization.\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;?php echo __( \'404\', \'text-domain\' ); ?&gt;\n\n// _e functions echo the value.\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;?php _e( \'404\', \'text-domain\' ); ?&gt;\n\n// Escape and echo the string.\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;?php esc_html_e( \'404\', \'text-domain\' ); ?&gt;\n\n// localization and variables.\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;?php _n( \'One post\', \'%s posts\', $count, \'text-domain\' ); ?&gt;\n</pre>\n\n\n<p>Strings output by functions must also be translation ready:</p>\n\n\n<pre class="brush: php; title: ; notranslate">\n// not translation-ready :-(\n&lt;?php next_posts_link( \'Older Entries\' ); ?&gt;\n\n// translation-ready :-)\n&lt;?php next_posts_link( esc_html__( \'Older Entries\', ‘text-domain’ ) ); ?&gt;\n</pre>\n\n\n<p>Tip: A lot of code examples in codex.wordpress.org don&#8217;t use the translation functions, so be careful when copy and pasting those.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Incorrectly Enqueuing Resources</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The .css and .js files your theme uses must be enqueued using the correct functions: wp_enqueue_style() for CSS and wp_enqueue_script() for Javascript.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A common error is to hardcode scripts and styles directly into the &lt;head&gt; or before &lt;/body&gt;. There are two problems to this approach:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Impossible to remove</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If a plugin needs to remove a resource you have loaded, it’s not possible. If you had used the proper enqueue functions it could be done like so:</p>\n\n\n<pre class="brush: php; title: ; notranslate">\n/**\n * Dequeue the theme javascript.\n *\n * Hooked to the wp_enqueue_scripts action, with a late priority (100),\n * so that it is after the script was enqueued.\n */\nfunction wptavern_dequeue_script() {\n   wp_dequeue_script( \'theme-scripts\' );\n}\nadd_action( \'wp_enqueue_scripts\', \'wptavern_dequeue_script\', 100 );\n</pre>\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Duplicate Loading</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you enqueue a resource, jQuery for example, and a plugin also enqueues it, WordPress is smart enough to only load it once.</p>\n\n\n<pre class="brush: php; title: ; notranslate">\n/**\n * Enqueue jQuery\n *\n * jQuery will only be loaded once, despite the two enqueues.\n * jQuery is packaged with WordPress so we don\'t need to specify a src. \n */\nfunction wptavern_enqueue_script() {\n   wp_enqueue_script( \'jquery\' );\n   wp_enqueue_script( \'jquery\' );\n}\nadd_action( \'wp_enqueue_scripts\', \'wptavern_enqueue_script\' );\n</pre>\n\n\n<p>If instead you had hardcoded jQuery into your &lt;head&gt; then there would be no way for WordPress to know, and it would be loaded twice.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Plugin-Territory Functionality</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The scope of a theme should only handle the design and aesthetic of a website, all other functionality should be handled by WordPress itself or plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an attempt to add more value to their themes, theme authors often try to incorporate extra functionality, for example, SEO controls or custom post types.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem with bundling functionality into a theme is that the data is not portable. Take SEO controls as an example, if the user changes the theme, they lose all the work they did to optimize their pages. In contrast by using an SEO plugin, the data and functionality is independent of the theme and will be retained when changing the theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some examples of plugin-territory functionality:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Analytics/Tracking</li><li>SEO controls</li><li>Contact Forms</li><li>Shortcodes</li><li>Gutenberg Blocks</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Tip: If your code writes to the database, it is highly likely to be plugin territory. The exception would be design-related settings (sidebar position, colors, etc.).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Not Prefixing</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Prefixing is a way of ensuring that your code doesn&#8217;t clash with code from plugins. Namespacing in PHP is a better way to achieve the same effect. However, some users are still using old versions of PHP (5.2) which don&#8217;t support that feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Justin Tadlock shared a list of common things that should be prefixed:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>PHP function names.</li><li>PHP class names.</li><li>PHP global variables.</li><li>Action/Filter hooks.</li><li>Script handles.</li><li>Style handles.</li><li>Image size names.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Source: <a href="https://themereview.co/prefix-all-the-things/">https://themereview.co/prefix-all-the-things/</a></p>\n\n\n<pre class="brush: php; title: ; notranslate">\n// function example.\nmy_prefix_example();\n\n// class example.\nclass My_Prefix_Example { … }\n\n// action and filter example.\ndo_action( \'my_prefix_action\' );\napply_filters( \'my_prefix_filter\', $values );\n\n// enqueue examples.\nwp_enqueue_script( \'my_prefix_script\', get_template_directory_uri() . \'/js/custom-script.js\' );\nwp_enqueue_style( \'my_prefix_style\', get_template_directory_uri() . \'/css/styles.css\' );\n\n// image size example.\nadd_image_size( \'my_prefix_image_size\', 220, 180 ); // 220 pixels wide by 180 pixels tall.\n</pre>\n\n\n<p>Exception: When enqueuing third-party resources, don’t add a prefix:</p>\n\n\n<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">\n // enqueuing a third-party script (chosen.js).\n wp_enqueue_script( \'chosen\', get_template_directory_uri() . \'/js/chosen.js\' );\n</pre>\n\n\n<h3><strong>Licensing Issues</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Your theme and all of its files must be 100% GPL-compatible. This includes images, libraries, scripts, and fonts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All third-party resources must list their source and license information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This requirement can be particularly tricky as not all licenses are GPL-friendly. The Unsplash license only has one restriction:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This license does not include the right to compile photos from Unsplash to replicate a similar or competing service.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That one restriction, however, is enough to make it non-GPL-compatible, and as such, you won&#8217;t see Unsplash images included in wordpress.org themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A list of GPL-compatible licenses is available here &#8211; <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#GPLCompatibleLicenses">https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#GPLCompatibleLicenses</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently,<strong> </strong><a href="https://stocksnap.io/">stocksnap.io</a> has been the most common source of images in the directory as <strong>all </strong>the images they list are licensed as CC0 (GPL-compatible).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Screenshot Mistakes</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The requirements state that your screenshot should be an unedited representation of your theme that doesn&#8217;t look like an advertisement. That means no photoshop work, overlays, borders or fancy effects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Images must also follow the same licensing requirements we explored above.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/42HUG_N4a7-I4LHNiJzeD9iI_rVCXD0_lb3UZEiaM18zJ0giqX479QUj9Dl35j2BQObf2DHaiQ7cgvoznWclzEcNo2HuwwGgsJ5eNjFW9vZvuzuBn7gev3wRuBz6SNC1XGMwoo4M" alt="" />theme pictured: <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/blocksy/">Blocksy</a>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Bonus: Use a Coding Standard</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Code that seems easy to read and understand for you, can be the complete opposite for a reviewer who only has 10-15 minutes to check your code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While there is no requirement on coding standards, following one does make your code easier to read, understand and maintain. I personally use and recommend the &#8216;<a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/php/">WordPress Coding Standards</a>&#8216;, though there are others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using PHP_CodeSniffer and the WordPress ruleset in your code editor can make adhering to a standard a lot easier &#8211; <a href="https://github.com/WordPress-Coding-Standards/WordPress-Coding-Standards">https://github.com/WordPress-Coding-Standards/WordPress-Coding-Standards</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Theme Requirements are created with the end user in mind. Avoid making the common mistakes I&#8217;ve listed above and your theme will be approved in no time.

The 24-hour global event hosted 77 local events in 35 countries and the Polyglots team added 183 new contributors to their ranks. The team also designated 12 new GTEs (Global Translation Editor) and 14 PTEs (Project Translation Editor).</p>\n<p>Naoko Takano, a Polyglots Team Global Mentor and Japanese GTE, gave an <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/naokomc/introduction-to-wordpress-translation-day-4-144893265" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">introduction</a> to the event from Tokyo for the livestream. In her presentation she shared some stats on the state of WordPress translation. WordPress is currently available in 201 locales with 614 GTEs, 3,086 PTEs, and 32,585 contributors. The majority of WordPress installs are in locales other than US English, representing an estimated 18% of the web.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-13-at-2.24.45-PM.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Takano also highlighted the top locales installed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Japanese: 5.9%</li>\n<li>German: 5.5%</li>\n<li>Spanish: 5.0%</li>\n<li>French: 3.8%</li>\n<li>English (UK): 3.7%</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Locales with most translation contributors include Spanish (2,863), German (2,399), Italian (2,190), Dutch (1,584), and Russian (1,515).

He explained the basics of translating WordPress and the attendees participated in Translation Day via the livestream. </p>\n<p>Dorji is passionate about completing the Dzongkha translation, encouraging Dzongkha bloggers, and improving local government websites. Many local government websites, such as the <a href="https://www.dzongkha.gov.bt/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dzongkha Development Commission</a>, rely on WordPress. As the organizer of the fledgling meetup, Dorji is full of ideas for growing the Bhutanese WordPress community.</p>\n<p>&#8220;My next plan is to visit the language university and teach them to blog in Dzongkha using WordPress,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have plans to gather a group of active Bhutanese WordPress bloggers and host panel talks. WordCamp Thimphu is my goal &#8211; to reach and invite more WordPress experts as speakers of the main event and help Bhutanese to grow their careers with WordPress.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In addition to launching a new WordPress community in Bhutan, participants in the Translation Day event translated thousands of strings and helped new teams make progress towards launching packages for WordPress 5.2. Some of the most popular plugins and themes are now more accessible to the global WordPress user base, thanks to contributions inspired by the virtual event. </p>\n<p>Events like this are a reminder of just far-reaching WordPress&#8217; influence is across cultures.

After growing tired of Trac&#8217;s mediocre search functionality, <a href="https://wearnhardt.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">William Earnhardt</a> set out to improve it with a new project called <a href="https://tracsearch.wpteamhub.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WPTracSearch</a> that gave him an opportunity to play around with Elasticsearch and React.</p>\n<p>WPTracSearch provides an alternative Elasticsearch-powered interface for searching WordPress Trac tickets. It performs a full text search of all of the fields, delivering more accurate results, even for basic queries, thanks to Elasticsearch&#8217;s relevance ranking. The results can be easily filtered based on milestone, component, focuses, usernames, and more criteria, making it easier to find specific tickets.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-10-at-3.01.51-PM.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The search interface also supports fuzzy matching, adding to its ability to deliver more relevant results. Even if a term is misspelled (either in the search or the ticket) it will still yield results, as in the example below:</p>\n<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/fuzzy-match.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Earnhardt is a WordPress core contributor and a developer at Bluehost. His core team has the discretion to work on whatever they want for WordPress core and the community. </p>\n<p>&#8220;This fit in nicely with that, but was also just something fun to tinker with,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It started as a fun experiment with Elasticsearch last fall. I built an index on my local machine and played around with it but got busy with other stuff pre-5.0 push and it sort of fell by the wayside.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Then early this year I had a few times come up where it would have been helpful, so I threw together an interface for it and got it online.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If you want to use WPTracSearch but are not sure how current the ticket index is, Earnhardt said it&#8217;s nearly constantly in sync:</p>\n<blockquote><p>There is a PHP script that parses all the information about a ticket in Trac using the XMLRPC api and puts it into an Elasticsearch index. There is a bash script that runs on a cron every minute to find any tickets updated since the last run and then uses the PHP script to reindex them. So it stays pretty constantly in sync.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The project uses a React interface that relies on the <a href="https://github.com/appbaseio/reactivesearch/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Reactivesearch</a> library to query the Elasticsearch index. Earnhardt also borrowed some code from Ryan McCue’s <a href="https://github.com/rmccue/not-trac" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Not Trac</a> to help with some of the UI that deals with parsing TracLinks and code blocks.</p>\n<p>WPTracSearch is an evolving project and Earnhardt has lots of plans for improving it. The two highest priority items on his roadmap are indexing meta Trac and making a search UI for it. He also wants to make the individual tickets have navigable URLs instead of being modal pop up windows when you click on the summary in the search results.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I do it that way because it’s a lot faster to stay in this interface than jumping back and forth to core.trac.wordpress.org when browsing tickets, but you can’t link directly to a ticket and forward/back doesn’t work,&#8221; Earnhardt said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You can also query the Elasticsearch index directly without using the React interface if you know Elasticsearch Query DSL. This allows pretty complex queries to be built. I’ve thought about creating some charts using that. It could help with the core triage team effort to better understand churn and progress toward bringing that open ticket count down. There are a lot of cool possibilities.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href="https://github.com/earnjam/wptracsearch" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WPTracSearch</a> is available on GitHub if anyone wants to contribute ideas or code to improve it.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 10 May 2019 21:42:55 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:71:"WPTavern: Tips for Replying to A Call for Papers or A Call for Speakers";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=89521";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:82:"https://wptavern.com/tips-for-replying-to-a-call-for-papers-or-a-call-for-speakers";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:10893:"<div class="wp-block-image"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The following is a guest post written by <a href="https://jenniferbourn.com/">Jennifer Bourn</a>. With 21 years experience as a graphic designer, 15 years experience as a web designer, 14 years as a creative agency owner, and 11 years as a blogger, Jennifer Bourn has worked with hundreds of service-based businesses to build brands and establish profitable online platforms. She also co-organizes the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Sacramento-WordPress/">Sacramento WordPress Meetup</a> and <a href="https://2019.sacramento.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp Sacramento</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After being the lead organizer for <a href="https://2019.sacramento.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp Sacramento</a> for two years, speaker wrangler for two years, managing the program for a year, and speaking at several WordCamps and non-WordPress related conferences myself, I have seen a lot of amazing and a lot of awful speaker submissions. Some speaker submissions have been from people I know personally — people I want to choose and say yes to — but ultimately couldn’t because their submission was subpar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s incredibly tough to both apply to speak and select speakers from applications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that in mind, I shared a <a href="https://twitter.com/jenniferbourn/status/1126608018953523200">Twitter thread</a> yesterday with tips for replying to a<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CallforPapers?src=hash"> Call for Papers or a Call for Speakers that will help you get your next talk submission accepted and it is summarized for your convenience below:</a></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class="wp-block-separator" />\n\n\n\n<p>If your title is confusing, weird, unclear, too cutesy, or it feels like you put no effort into it, that will work against you. Organizers want talks attendees will be interested in and excited for. It must be easy to understand what the talk is about based on the title alone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your talk description is all about you, is only one sentence long, is sarcastic/unprofessional, isn’t aligned with the event focus/theme, or it’s totally self-serving, you should rethink things. Your talk isn’t about you, it’s about helping attendees expand their knowledge and move the needle and helping organizers host a successful event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is never ever a good idea to disparage or put down a person, job, tool, piece of software, or anyone/anything to make your point or make your topic interesting. If the only way you can communicate your point is through negativity, reconsider the topic. Being controversial may have been a draw in years past, but now it’s a risk most organizers aren’t willing to take.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider that someone else (or several people) may submit a talk on the exact same subject. Your title and description need to convince organizers why your submission should be picked over the other person’s submission.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider that if you submit multiple talks, none of them may be selected if your titles aren’t interesting and your descriptions are not descriptive. It must be clear what the talk is about and what the takeaways are, and how this talk will benefit the attendees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Always think about how you can make the organizers’ or event planners’ jobs easier and follow instructions. For example, if they ask for bios in third-person, provide your bio in third-person. If they ask for full name, provide your full name.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spell the name of the conference, software, industry, etc. correctly in your speaker application. Want to speak at a WordPress event? Double check that you’ve capitalized the P and proofread your submission.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Look at the topics requested by the event organizers. Submit talks on those topics and your chances of being selected will be higher because they are telling you what they want. Lists of preferred topics are usually included because that is what their local community has specifically requested.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t submit the same talk you’ve submitted 10 times to other events. Put in some effort. Look at the event theme and submit something that relates to it or customize the talk title/description to include the theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Look at the past event schedules, agenda, or programs. Look at the types of talks they accept. For example, if a WordCamp has only had 2-3 business related talks in the past four years, it might be a sign they aren’t looking for business talks and want talks focused more on using WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Look at the topics the event has already covered in previous years. Then find the gap and find something they haven’t already heard or done. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steer clear of the marketing hype. Avoid topics related to killing it, hustling, crushing, and dominating. Don’t refer to yourself as a guru or a thought leader (that’s only cool when other people say it about you). Avoid negativity, sarcasm, and assumptions about the audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If organizers ask how or why you’re qualified to talk on the topic being submitted:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>It’s okay to be new/just learning — fresh voices are awesome.</li><li>Don’t just copy and paste your bio into the field. They already have your bio and that’s not what they meant or what they want.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Never assume the people reviewing your application are experts on your talk topic or have the same technical background you do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Avoid submitting a talk that is all about one piece of software — i.e. one plugin — especially if the software is premium and requires an investment. An entire session dedicated to a paid plugin <strong>1)</strong> excludes those who have not purchased it or cannot purchase it and <strong>2)</strong> will apply to few attendees. Instead, consider a compare/contrast presentation that covers both free and paid options or a talk that introduces attendees to multiple options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s okay to submit opinion pieces as talks, but be careful to <strong>NOT</strong> position your opinion or approach as the only one or the right one, when there are other options. Often there isn&#8217;t one right way (unless it&#8217;s technical and there is one right way).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the submission form asks what skill level audience your talk is the best fit — Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced — don&#8217;t pick them all. That isn&#8217;t helpful. The same is true if they ask who your talk is aimed at — designers, developers, or users, etc. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organizers for events like WordCamps need to satisfy a diverse audience. The attendee makeup often ranges from those who make a living with WordPress all the way to newbies who just learned what WordPress is a few days ago, so talks at and for every skill level are needed and valued. Don’t skip applying because you think your talk isn’t advanced enough.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If there is a &#8216;notes to the organizer&#8217; field in the talk submission form, communicate that you&#8217;re open to suggestions or making tweaks to the talk focus to ensure it&#8217;s a great fit for their audience. Often a talk being reviewed is close to what they want, but it needs a small tweak to be selected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If something funky happened when you hit submit, don&#8217;t be afraid to submit your talk again. Organizers would rather have duplicate submissions than miss your submission. Also, it&#8217;s okay to reach out to confirm your submission was received. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t skip applying to speak because you don&#8217;t think you know enough yet or don’t have enough experience yet. Everyone has value to contribute and fresh perspectives are always appreciated. Plus, there are people who just discovered or figured out the thing you want to talk about exists — I guarantee you can help them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Behind the scenes organizers work hard to create a diverse lineup of speakers that provides representation for everyone in the community. Organizers can ask, beg, plead, and do loads of outreach, but ultimately, they are limited by who is willing to apply and/or who is willing to accept an invite to speak. So please say yes and apply.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When organizers make the offer to help you brainstorm talk ideas, craft a talk title/description, and even create your slide deck or watch your practice, say yes. Take them up on the offer. Asking for help doesn&#8217;t make you any less awesome. There are a lot of people who are incredibly talented and smart with great value to share but find it difficult to put what they know into a talk format. If that’s you, you’re not alone and there are people who want to help.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Interested in trying your hand at speaking for the first time? </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Every event has limited space. When securing rooms for multi-track events and planning the schedule, organizers need to be able to split attendees across the different rooms/tracks. This means they need competing talks in each track that will be a draw and attract attendees. No one wants one full room and one empty room. No one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don&#8217;t get selected, don&#8217;t get down on yourself. Often the selection choice has nothing to do with you and is simply a matter of many submissions on the same topic(s), needing to balance topics across disciplines to serve the range of attendees or skill sets, and looking for more diverse representation in the speaker lineup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the event is local to you, always apply. Many times event/conference organizers want to fill the speaking spots (or at least half of them) with local people from their community or region and you&#8217;ll have a leg up on the out-of-towners. Similarly, if there is a meetup group in the area tied to the event/conference, go to the meetup and get to know the organizers and other attendees. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>New to a subject/topic? Just learning it? No problem! Consider submitting a talk reviewing your experience as a new user. Share surprises and obstacles encountered, lessons learned, and suggestions for improvement. This can be hugely valuable for advanced users who tend to what new users deal with and it can provide a different perspective and voice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to learn a topic better? There&#8217;s no better way than to teach others about it. Submit the talk, do the work to learn it, and teach everything you’ve learned so far. For example, if you want to build a membership site, submit a talk on how to choose a membership plugin, document your research in finding the right plugin, and share what plugins you reviewed, what criteria you used for evaluation, what you discovered (pros/cons), and which you ended up choosing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Never underestimate the power of awareness. Consider pitching a talk that presents options to expand attendees awareness of what is available or possible and gives them a starting place to research things on their own.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 10 May 2019 18:32:16 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:68:"WPTavern: Storefront 2.5.0 Introduces a Custom, Block-Based Homepage";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=89483";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:78:"https://wptavern.com/storefront-2-5-0-introduces-a-custom-block-based-homepage";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1855:"<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/storefront/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Storefront</a>, WooCommerce&#8217;s free flagship theme, has just released version <a href="https://woocommerce.wordpress.com/2019/05/09/storefront-2-5-0-is-now-available-to-download/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2.5.0</a> with updates that make it easier to setup and customize the homepage. </p>\n<p>In 2017, WooCommerce 2.2 introduced starter content to help users set up the homepage template, menus, widgets, and add some demo products.

ACF Blocks was announced in October 2018, to the great relief of many developers who didn&#8217;t know how they were going to keep pace with learning the JavaScript required to use WordPress&#8217; Block API. </p>\n<p>ACF&#8217;s creator, Elliot Condon, was one of the more vocal critics of Gutenberg leading up to its inclusion in WordPress 5.0. Developers were concerned about whether or not their custom metaboxes generated by ACF would still be compatible. The ACF team worked to ensure the plugin was integrated into the Gutenberg UI as much as possible and surprised users by announcing an acf_register_block() function that would allow developers to use PHP to create custom blocks.</p>\n<p>The new ACF Blocks add-on is built on top of Advanced Custom Fields Pro and does not require any JavaScript knowledge. It integrates with custom fields so developers can create custom solutions. ACF blocks are rendered using a PHP template file or a callback function that allows full control of the output HTML and live previews while editing the blocks. They also maintain native compatibility with WordPress core, meaning that all Gutenberg features like &#8220;alignment&#8221; and &#8220;re-usable blocks&#8221; work as expected.</p>\n<p>Early feedback indicates that ACF Blocks has made custom Gutenberg development more approachable for developers who are not as well-versed in React, significantly speeding up the creation of custom blocks.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">ACF Pro 5.8 for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordPress?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#WordPress</a> makes Gutenberg block development a breeze!

The plugin now enables fewer features on setup so users can have more control over what they activate on their sites.  </p>\n<p>The new version also integrates with WordPress 5.2&#8217;s new Site Health checks. It includes a status check and moves Jetpack&#8217;s legacy debug data to a section in the new &#8220;Site Health Info&#8221; tab. The initial status check isn&#8217;t very descriptive regarding critical errors, but these error messages can be improved in future iterations so users know how to get to a page with more information. </p>\n<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Screen-Shot-2019-05-08-at-11.57.44-AM.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<h3>New Membership Block Now Available for Jetpack Beta Testers</h3>\n<p>Jetpack is getting ready to introduce a new <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/pull/9802" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Membership block</a> that will essentially function like a recurring donation button using Stripe as the payment gateway. </p>\n<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/jetpack-membership-button.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Users will be able to set the currency, price, product name, and renewal interval directly within the block.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/membership-block-configure.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>This release adds the new block behind the JETPACK_BETA_BLOCKS constant for users who are beta testing new blocks. Feedback from testers will be addressed in future pull requests. The PR merged into Jetpack 7.3 includes the following technical additions for the new Membership block:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Introduce endpoints that communicate with WP.COM</li>\n<li>Whitelist certain options, CPTs and meta to store / sync data</li>\n<li>Introduce Gutenberg block that uses these endpoints and provides UI to connect to Stripe, create and choose a product</li>\n<li>Introduce a frontend of a block with the sole purpose of displaying a checkout window from WP.com in an iframe</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In its current form, the use of the term &#8220;Membership&#8221; for the block might be a bit misleading for some users, depending on their expectations. Site owners usually expect more granular management of members, multiple membership tiers, customizable emails, various renewal options, content access, and more for managing memberships. </p>\n<p>Unless Jetpack intends to make this the gateway to more robust membership capabilities, then &#8220;Recurring donation/payment button&#8221; might be a more accurate name for the block. However, it wouldn&#8217;t be surprising to see a more full-featured Membership module turn up as a SaaS product from WordPress.com, as opposed to everything getting packed into the plugin.</p>\n<p>No release date has been announced for the membership block as it is still under active development and in the very early stages of beta testing.</p>\n<p>Check out the full <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/#developers" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">changelog</a> to see all the enhancements and bug fixes in Jetpack 7.3.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 08 May 2019 17:57:43 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:"type";i:128;s:7:"headers";O:42:"Requests_Utility_CaseInsensitiveDictionary":1:{s:7:"\0*\0data";a:8:{s:6:"server";s:5:"nginx";s:4:"date";s:29:"Mon, 03 Jun 2019 23:25:32 GMT";s:12:"content-type";s:8:"text/xml";s:4:"vary";s:15:"Accept-Encoding";s:13:"last-modified";s:29:"Mon, 03 Jun 2019 23:15:29 GMT";s:15:"x-frame-options";s:10:"SAMEORIGIN";s:4:"x-nc";s:9:"HIT ord 1";s:16:"content-encoding";s:4:"gzip";}}s:5:"build";s:14:"20130911040210";}', 'no');
